        <p>We spent a week on Madeira in the last week in August before the school holidays finished.</p>
<h2>The house</h2>
<p>We booked what looked like a large house with pool and sea view somewhat above our usual price range and I wasn't sure what to expect. Well, we had the rare experience of the accomodation being exactly as advertised! A lovely sea view over the Arco da Calheta. The pool was large enough to almost swim lengths and play improvised water polo. The accomodation included a jacuzzi and a sauna, neither of which ended up using since the pool was enough. Perfect.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2023/madeira-3.webp" alt=""></p>
<h2>The car</h2>
<p>When picking up the car at the airport, a 1.2 litre Citroen, the lady at the desk was trying to get me to upgrade to a more powerful car for 200 Euro. She justified this given that Madeira had plenty of steep hills and given that there would be four of us in the car 1.2 litres might not be enough. I figured this was just a scam and chose not to. Well, I hadn't expected the roads to be quite so steep, especially off the main ones. Lack of power meant going uphill was largely done in first gear, unable to change up into second. Should we come again, I will try a more powerful car.</p>

<h2>The climate and nature</h2>
<p>We had a week of perfect weather. Not too hot, a little cloudy at times, pleasant in the evenings. Perfect. Up in the hills it was often cloudy, but down by the sea it was sunny. Madeira is full of Banana plantations on the hillsides around the coast. Higher up it takes on a distinct tropical feel. The terraced fields made it look like my memories of Bali. And some of the flora and fauna gave it a distinct Hawaii look and feel. Fantastic.</p>
<h2>Day 1: Funchal</h2>
<p>On the first full day we headed off to Funchal, had a walk around the sea front area and then got on the cable car up the hill to the Monte Park area. Here we walked around a little and visited the &quot;Nossa Senhora do Monte&quot; church.</p>
<p>We then walked all the steep 4km back down to the sea front. Our muscles thanked us the next day. An interesting aspect of this was walking alongside the levadas as we went. The levadas are a network of canals brining water from all over the island to where it is needed.  Usually you follow these on the walks in the centre of the island. I wasn't expecting to walk next to them in Funchal. They do flow at quite a speed in the steep parts.</p>
<p>After the walk down, we sat in a poncha bar for a well deserved drink, before heading home.</p>

        <h2>by Iain M Banks</h2>
<p>His final Culture Series novel before his death marks a very fitting end to the series. It covers the notion of Subliming, where by advanced galactic civilisations voluntarily dissapear into the &quot;Ether&quot; as they feel their time in the &quot;Real&quot; is finished. As such it has some qualities of death itself. I don't think Banks knew he had cancer when writing this book. Judging by the interview in the back of the book he was planning on writing more Culture novels. Sadly that will not happen.</p>
<p>One of the questions this book asks is do you tell your good friend and distant relative that the whole basis and meaning of their life was a lie just before they die. You know they have this suspicion, but still they believe they lie. Do you tell them or do you let them go to the other side believing a lie? Perhaps it doesn't matter even if you tell them. They like the lie too much.</p>
