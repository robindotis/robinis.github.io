        <p>For the last couple of days I was in Malta in order to give a presentation to <a href="https://inhope.org/EN">INHOPE</a> on how to ensure their hotlines are accessible. I got there via a change in Frankfurt and returned the same way. The one thing I love about flying between Schengen countries is that there are no border controls. This meant that the only point I had to show my ID card during the whole trip was first in Luxembourg to check I am the person it says on my ticket when entering the security checks and then when checking in at the hotel. Fantastic! It makes getting out of airports so much easier, especially if you only have hand luggage.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2023/malta-landing.webp" alt="Landing in Malta"></p>
<p>After a 25 minute taxi ride to the hotel I checked in and then explored the area a little. Getting to the conference venue would be a pleasant 15 minute stroll in the morning. The immediate area around my hotel, whilst OK, wasn't anything worth writing home about from a tourist point of view. But then this was a work trip!</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2023/malta-st-julian.webp" alt="Small maltese cove in the sunset"></p>
<p>The conference, which was actually an INHOPE Hotline Training Meeting took place in the Grand Ballroom of the Raddisson Blu.  I wasn't expecting this. Rarely giving presentations and if so maybe in front of 10 people or online, when I accepted to give the presentation I was expecting something quite small. When I was told it would be about 60 people, I assumed this was an exaggeration. It turned out to possibly be an underestimate.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2023/malta-grand-ballroom.webp" alt="Grand Ballroom with three chandeliers with the screen at the back showing the slides"></p>
<p>The day after the arrival I followed the conference with interest. In the evening I walked around a bit more, this time in the other direction (a little to the south-east), passed Spinola Bay and around St. Julian's Bay. I found that direction to be a little more interesting with a nicer beach walk. I caught a glimpse of the Balluta Building and the church next to it.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2023/malta-view-balluta.webp" alt="Impressive art nouveau Balluta Building"></p>
<p>Then I returned to the hotel to prepare for my presentation the next morning. This went much better than I was expecting with a number of hotline representatives asking me to send them my presentation. After lunch, I went to the airport to catch my flight back. So I didn't get to see a lot of Malta. I enjoyed the sun and warmth and the somewhat arabic architecture of the buildings. The conference was insightful and my presentation a success. So overall a good two days away and on the flight back I got a nice view of the alps.</p>

        <p>A nice little walk in the woods above Steinsel with Angie. I came across &quot;Yet Another Roman Ruin&quot;. Discovered in 1957 apparently. Not sure the columns are actually real. Good for effect though.</p>

          <h2><a href="/posts/2023/wordpress/">Goodbye to Wordpress</a></h2>
          <time datetime="2023-04-13 09:33:27">
            <span class="date-day">13</span> 
            <span class="date-month">April</span>,

        <p>Today I deleted my remaining Wordpress sites and cancelled my Wordpress account. And so ends over <a href="/history/">13 years of Wordpress hosting</a>.</p>
<p>Since moving my site to Eleventy, I had kept my two remaining Wordpress sites online only because an old post about the <a href="/posts/2013/epson-scan-window-wont-open/">Epson printer window</a> on one site was still quite popular. But that post no longer got any hits in the last couple of years, so it was OK to turn off the site. That left one remaining site where I had a collected a few paintings of mine. I copied those to this site as a <a href="/posts/2023/creative-eye/">post called Creative Eye</a>.</p>
<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>I always liked <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a>, the internet's most successful CMS platform. It's open source nature and the philosophy of it's creator certainly appealed to me. It was easy to install when self-hosting and easy to use whether self-hosted or on <a href="http://Wordpress.com">Wordpress.com</a>. And the price point was perfect: $0. Something I blogged about a while back when <a href="/posts/2021/netlify-wordpress/">comparing it to JAMStack sites</a>.</p>
<p>However, in recent years I did find the act of writing a post got more complex than it needed to be. The Guttenberg editor was surely a reason for this. I never quite got the hang of it, even if I could understand the idea behind it. On top of this, the sheer number of options meant it was sometimes hard to find where to do what if you didn't use the tool regularly.</p>
<p>So, I say goodbye to Wordpress not because it is a bad choice of CMS, but because I found a setup more <a href="/posts/2022/replacing-forestry/">suitable for my needs</a>.</p>
