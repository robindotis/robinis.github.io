          <h2>by Rupal Patel and Jack Meaning</h2>
<p>A book on introductory economics written by employees of the The Bank of England. Very easy to read and generally easy to follow. Understanding some of the theory without some background knowledge of economics might be difficult though. The book could have paid more attention to explaining some of the terminology and concepts. Still it is a good book to get a better understanding of some of the everyday questions on economics you might have. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>What causes recessions?</li>
<li>What is inflation and is it good or bad?</li>
<li>What is money?</li>
<li>Are banks useful?</li>
<li>Should governments be in debt?</li>
<li>And the book's title: Can't we just print more money?</li>
</ul>
<p>Some criticism is due because it tends to support the status quo, along the lines of &quot;it is what it is&quot;. It is honest enough to stress that economics is not a real science and very much hit and miss. It also finishes with a &quot;call to arms&quot;, trying to get more people interested in economics in order to shake up the status quo. More discussions on some of the social consequences of the choices available to governments, banks and economists would have been useful.</p>
<p>For example, the different types of taxes that can be raised and from whom. Taxing the very rich or companies has very different consequences to taxing the poor. If the aim is to keep money in the system, then there needs to be a way to limit the very rich from taking it out of the system and put it in offshore bank accounts for example.</p>
<p>Likewise, the US can run much larger debt ratio than other countries, because of its political and military importance. Similarly, Japan has the highest debt ratio in the world, but this is not a problem because much of it is held by its citizens and generally the world trusts Japan to repay its debt. So again, like taxes, not all debt is equal.</p>
<p>The book does hint at these sorts of questions in the conclusion and it is intended as an introduction, not a study. It also mentions that most of the public does not understand the consequences of the economic policies they are voting for. Addressing things like taxation and debt in more detail, but still in plain language, might have been useful in achieving the goals of the book.</p>

<p>Count Zero is the follow on book to <a href="/posts/2023/neuromancer/">Neuromancer</a>, which I read last month. It took me a little longer to finish, so I think I missed some of the detail. It was an interesting read, possibly more so even than Neuromancer, although not as ground breaking. I think I will have to re-read this one in a shorter time frame to make more sense of it.</p>
<p>Started 13/11/2023. Finished 22/12/2023.</p>

          <p>This morning, walking Angie in one of the locations we rarely go to, Angie disappeared. I was walking ahead as usual, she was dilly dallying at the back. When I retraced my steps to go and find her, she was gone. After about half an hour of whistling and shouting I started to get quite worried. I went back to the car to see if she was there, then I called my wife to come back from work to help find her. I also called a nearby neighbour who I know from walking our dogs. She came and helped look with her dog, Tashi. But all to no good. She phoned her bedsitter to check if Angie had returned to our house. No luck.</p>
<p>The neighbour went back to the village, and opened the gate to our garden so Angie could go in, if she returned. At that time my wife had returned home as well and between them half the village was now looking for Angie.</p>
<p>In the meantime I went back to my car and drove down the hill to the houses below where we were walking. This was about 90 minutes after she went missing. Walking around there, a lady came out of one of the houses, asking if I was looking for a dog. I said yes, and she mentioned that another lady, a teacher, had found a dog and put her in her van and gone to work at the school. The teacher had given the lady her phone number. So I got in touch with the teacher and started heading to the school she worked at.</p>
<p>It turns out the teacher had already posted a message on Facebook which our direct neighbour had already seen, recognised Angie, contacted the teacher separately and was heading to the school with my wife. I followed along and we were reunited with Angie about two and half hours after she went missing. They'd even cleaned her! I guess dirty dogs are not allowed in schools.</p>
<p>It is very nice to see how quickly things can come together when everyone helps - and how social media can actually be put to good use as well from time to time!</p>
<p>And that is my Christmas Tale for 2023. üéÖüéÑ</p>
