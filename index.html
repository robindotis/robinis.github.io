        <h2>by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J Dubner</h2>
<p>A straightforward read about what happens when you use the data available to answer interesting questions. The key being that you need to know to ask these interesting questions in the first place.</p>
<p>In the data driven world we now live in it is on the one hand now not that exceptional, 20 years after it's first publication. On the other hand it underlines the need to ask interesting questions if we are going to make good use of all this data.</p>
<p>One of the added on chapters included the question &quot;Why do people vote when no single vote ever really matters&quot;. Whilst the point being is valid, in reality every vote counts. As the recent, potentially manipulated by targeted advertising, vote on Brexit showed.</p>

        <p>Not one, but two concerts in a week for us. We just got back from <a href="/posts/2023/rock-werchter-2023/">Rock Werchter on Sunday</a> Tuesday 4th July and we were back in front of a stage. This time watching the <a href="https://arcticmonkeys.com/">Arctic Monkeys</a> at the more conveniently located Luxexpo in Luxembourg.</p>
<p>We got there at 8.45pm, just in time to watch the band take the stage. Not really knowing too much of their music, I found it interesting and well worth attending. The stage setup and the music was a bit of throwback to the '50s which made the whole evening very nice.</p>

        <p>Having enjoyed last year's <a href="/posts/2022/rock-werchter-2022/">day at Rock Werchter</a> so much, we got to tickets to see <a href="https://redhotchilipeppers.com/">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a> at <a href="https://www.rockwerchter.be/en/">Rock Werchter 2023</a> this year.</p>
<h2>The Black Keys</h2>
<p>Since it was a work day, we only got there around 6.30pm and first up were the Black Keys. They were not really our thing, but it was a good start to the evening.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2023/black-keys.webp" alt="The Black Keys playing on the Main stage"></p>
<h2>The Hu</h2>
<p>Whilst waiting for Liam Gallagher to appear on the main stage, we walked around a little and caught the last few minutes of <a href="https://www.thehuofficial.com/music">The Hu</a> on the Klub C stage. They are a monogolian rock / techno / group whom I did not know before and they were great. I will have to find another show of theirs!</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2023/the-hu.webp" alt="The Hu playing on the Klub C stage"></p>
<h2>Pup</h2>
<p>Then we ambled over to the Slope where we watched Canadian group <a href="https://www.puptheband.com/">Pup</a> for about 15 minutes, who were also good fun whith fantastic music. Interestingly the Slope had been turned around so it faced the stage, rather than the stage being underneath it!</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2023/pup.webp" alt="Pup playing on the Slope stage"></p>
<h2>Liam Gallagher</h2>
<p>We returned to the main stage to watch <a href="https://www.liamgallagher.com/home/">Liam Gallagher</a> play, but we were not impressed. Nor were the crowd I don't think. Oasis were great in their day and their songs are still fantastic. But on stage, Liam was very poor and lifeless. I realise that is his thing, but times have changed and I think crowds expect more of a show. It didn't help that he completely failed to build up a connection with the crowd - his arrogant appearance and inuendos not really making an impact. You're not in Manchester, Liam, it's Rock Werchter!</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2023/liam-gallagher.webp" alt="Liam Gallagher on the main stage"></p>
<h2>Red Hot Chili Peppers</h2>
<p>We hung around near the front of the Main stage for an hour, until Red Hot Chili Peppers were on at 23:30. We were thinking of getting into the enclosure right in front of the stage, but decided not to. So we watched them from the &quot;second row&quot; as it were. They were great!</p>

<p>Good Night Rock Werchter, again!</p>
