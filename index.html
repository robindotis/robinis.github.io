        <h2>by Suzanne Heywood</h2>
<p>This book depicts the 10 years the author spent sailing around the world with her parents and younger brother. She departed England at the age of seven on their boat, the <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/wavewalker-suzanne-heywood/6898356?ean=9780008498498">Wavewalker</a>.</p>
<p>It's quite an adventure, including a near death experience in the Indian Ocean a couple of years into the trip. However the actual story of the book is that of a young girl spending the best 10 years of her youth lonely at sea, rather than socialising with friends at school.  Whilst the story turns out well, with the author going to Oxford University, the author is clear: this was not the idylic childhood her parents pretended she had and she has the psychological scars to show it. The fact that she coped so well is quite a miracle. She was more often than not neglected by her parents, both psychologically and physically. They essentially abandoned her in the middle of nowhere in New Zealand to look after her brother, whilst the parents continued sailing to &quot;earn money&quot;. She finally &quot;escaped&quot; to England for an interview at Oxford.</p>
<p>An easy read and well told story. I finished it whilst <a href="/posts/2023/inhope-malta/">travelling to Malta</a> and back. A little repetitive at times, but then I guess that is the point. The 10 years were not all fun and games. At all.</p>

        <p>For the last couple of days I was in Malta in order to give a presentation to <a href="https://inhope.org/EN">INHOPE</a> on how to ensure their hotlines are accessible. I got there via a change in Frankfurt and returned the same way. The one thing I love about flying between Schengen countries is that there are no border controls. This meant that the only point I had to show my ID card during the whole trip was first in Luxembourg to check I am the person it says on my ticket when entering the security checks and then when checking in at the hotel. Fantastic! It makes getting out of airports so much easier, especially if you only have hand luggage.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2023/malta-landing.webp" alt="Landing in Malta"></p>
<p>After a 25 minute taxi ride to the hotel I checked in and then explored the area a little. Getting to the conference venue would be a pleasant 15 minute stroll in the morning. The immediate area around my hotel, whilst OK, wasn't anything worth writing home about from a tourist point of view. But then this was a work trip!</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2023/malta-st-julian.webp" alt="Small maltese cove in the sunset"></p>
<p>The conference, which was actually an INHOPE Hotline Training Meeting took place in the Grand Ballroom of the Raddisson Blu.  I wasn't expecting this. Rarely giving presentations and if so maybe in front of 10 people or online, when I accepted to give the presentation I was expecting something quite small. When I was told it would be about 60 people, I assumed this was an exaggeration. It turned out to possibly be an underestimate.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2023/malta-grand-ballroom.webp" alt="Grand Ballroom with three chandeliers with the screen at the back showing the slides"></p>
<p>The day after the arrival I followed the conference with interest. In the evening I walked around a bit more, this time in the other direction (a little to the south-east), passed Spinola Bay and around St. Julian's Bay. I found that direction to be a little more interesting with a nicer beach walk. I caught a glimpse of the Balluta Building and the church next to it.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2023/malta-view-balluta.webp" alt="Impressive art nouveau Balluta Building"></p>
<p>Then I returned to the hotel to prepare for my presentation the next morning. This went much better than I was expecting with a number of hotline representatives asking me to send them my presentation. After lunch, I went to the airport to catch my flight back. So I didn't get to see a lot of Malta. I enjoyed the sun and warmth and the somewhat arabic architecture of the buildings. The conference was insightful and my presentation a success. So overall a good two days away and on the flight back I got a nice view of the alps.</p>

        <p>A nice little walk in the woods above Steinsel with Angie. I came across &quot;Yet Another Roman Ruin&quot;. Discovered in 1957 apparently. Not sure the columns are actually real. Good for effect though.</p>
