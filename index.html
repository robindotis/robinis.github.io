        <p>Twenty years after my last walk to Sveta Petka monastery in the hills above Asenovgrad, I did the same again. This is a religious day specific to the monastery and it started appropriately by saving the life of a dog. This poor chap:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2023/sveta-petka-dog.webp" alt="Dog resting in dried grass in front of a monastery"></p>
<p>had fallen into a reservoir and couldn't climb out of the water due to the steep smooth concrete banks. So the tallest guy in our group, held by two others, climbed over the barrier and pulled the dog out of the water. We gave the dog some bread and went on our way up the steep hill to the monastery. At the top we saw the dog resting in front of the official ceremony of the monastery. Holy dog indeed!</p>
<p>Sveta Petka monastery is known for being a hiding place for Bulgarian revolutionary, Vasil Levski. I saw his hiding place 20 years ago, so didn't queue this timee to see it, but the monastery itself is reasonably well maintained, with on-going construction works and well worth a visit.</p>
<p>We carried on past the monastery, through masses of people and found a spot about about a few hundred metres further along. Actually, we didn't find it, it's where the group always has their picnic on this hike.</p>
<p>By the time I got there the others had already started the fire!</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2023/sveta-petka-fire.webp" alt="Log fire for BBQ"></p>
<p>The wine and rakia started flowing and soon those more musical than me started dancing the &quot;Horo&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2023/sveta-petka-horo.webp" alt="People line dancing the Horo"></p>
<p>After having relaxed in that spot for several hours, we continued on to catch the last of the sunset and then headed down the steep and rocky path with our head torches. After a quick stop at a rock called &quot;Anathem&quot;, we continued on to the little &quot;Sveta Petka&quot; church with this lovely view of the town half way down the hill.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2023/sveta-petka-cross.webp" alt="Cross lit up at night with Asenovgrad glowing in the background"></p>
<p>This was a great day out. The last time I had done this hike was in snow with sub zero temperatures 20 years ago. This time it was 20¬∞C. I guess this is climate change.</p>
<p>This is what it looked like 20 years ago.</p>

        <p>Recently, I came across a couple of posts about the usefullness of JavaScript frameworks, such as <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>. Their promise is to simplify the creation of modern web applications. These discussions seem to kick off every now and then in the same way that 20 years ago people debated Java vs .Net and 40 years ago it was probably C vs Perl. The current debate is often centered around the speed of the pages using frameworks, which are bulkier and slower than native rendering.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://infrequently.org/2023/02/the-market-for-lemons/">the market for lemons</a>, Alex wrote a very good description of how these frameworks are knowingly over selling their benefits (faster development, easier to maintain, better support, access to a arger developer pool). A key takeaway for me was that these frameworks do give significant benefits to large teams able to invest and maintain in them. Smaller teams however, tend to get bogged down in their complexity the moment you go beyond the defaults. It's a bit like the &quot;blog in five minutes&quot; use cases that popped up all over the place when <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby On Rails</a> turned up 20 years ago. Of course RoR was truly revolutionary at the time and incredibly powerful, but the same was not true for other frameworks of the time.</p>
<p>In response, Laurie posted <a href="https://seldo.com/posts/the_case_for_frameworks">the case for frameworks</a> in support of React and JavaScript frameworks. His main argument, whilst acknowlegding certain failings of frameworks, is that you're OK because everyone is doing it. This is the 2020s reload of the &quot;no one ever got fired for picking IBM&quot; thinking in the 80s.</p>
<p>But are these frameworks as popular as they seem. Andy takes a look his post <a href="https://andy-bell.co.uk/the-extremely-loud-minority/">the (extremely) loud minority</a> and concludes &quot;not really&quot;. Obviously there are thousands of sites using React, but only 3.3% of the top 10 million websites actually use it. The percentage of all websites is probably much smaller. In comparison, Wordpress is used by 43.1% of the top 10 million websites. The reason these frameworks seem more popular than they actually is explained in <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/15011">dev perception</a> by Jeremy.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> is still used on over 77% of the top 10 million websites. 16 years after it's first release. It's popularity is only now starting to dip. There are many reasons for it's popularity.</p>
<p>One reason is that jQuery was released at a time when web standards were poorly supported by browsers. This meant developers had to write code for each of the common browsers at the time. jQuery provided a standardising layer, which enabled your code to work well in all browsers.</p>
<p>A second is that it was not released by a big tech company. jQuery was created by one guy, John Resig. Since there was no big company owning jQuery, other companies didn't feel the need to compete and release their own framework. There was no competition and it quickly became the defacto framework used by anyone programming front-end JavaScript.</p>
<p>A third reason is that jQuery was quite simple to get started with. You could sprinkle it lightly throughout your code, or you could base all your code around it.</p>
<p>The reason for it's recent dip: browsers are finally more or less equal in terms of standars support and the use case for jQuery is waning, especially in new projects.</p>
<p>All of this leads me to the actual point I want to make. It's about the most common framework, used by 100% of all websites. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldWideWeb">work in progress since 1990</a>. It is of course the browser using standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Sure, it doesn't always have the latest bells and whistles like, instead its future support is unparalled. It will never be obsolete.</p>
<p>You can't go wrong choosing it. In fact you can't avoid choosing it!</p>

        <p>Tuesday 7th February was <a href="https://www.saferinternetday.org/">Safer Internet Day</a> in 2023. It also marks the 20th year of the initiative, which is supported by the European Commission through the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/safer-internet-day">Safer Internet team of DG CONNECT</a>.</p>
<p>As part of that day, we arranged a morning in the <a href="https://www.lmrl.lu/">Lycee Michel-Rodange</a> in Luxembourg City, to let a class of the school try out the latest VR headsets from Meta. The kids, all around 15 years of age, got to try out five different VR worlds as they circulated around different stands in a class room. After that they had a brief discussion, giving their thoughts on VR in their futures.</p>
<p>It's been a long time since I was in a class room full of 15 year olds and it was incredibly energising. They were all well behaved, whilst having their fun with the headsets. Maybe that is the Luxembourg effect!</p>
<p>Best of all, in my opinion, was the lack of enthusiasm for this technology with these kids. Our polling showed they did not believe this technology would become an alternate world for them in the future. Whilst they saw the use of it in certain educational situations, few would be interested VR being their main medium of education. Despite growing up with always connected smartphones, they still apparently wanted face to face contact with their friends. They certainly didn't want to live in the VR world.</p>
<p>My own take on this, having tried out the headsets, is that they are simply not ready for the mainstream. The technology is too fiddly and, despite being relatively easy to use, is too cumbersome to do what appear to be basic things. I certainly can't see the advantage over a physical meeting with colleagues, or even a video-conference. There's still a long way to go before this tech can become mainstream. Maybe it never will, at least not in this form. And certainly not for entertainment or socialising purposes.</p>
