        <p>Recently, I came across a couple of posts about the usefullness of JavaScript frameworks, such as <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>. Their promise is to simplify the creation of modern web applications. These discussions seem to kick off every now and then in the same way that 20 years ago people debated Java vs .Net and 40 years ago it was probably C vs Perl. The current debate is often centered around the speed of the pages using frameworks, which are bulkier and slower than native rendering.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://infrequently.org/2023/02/the-market-for-lemons/">the market for lemons</a>, Alex wrote a very good description of how these frameworks are knowingly over selling their benefits (faster development, easier to maintain, better support, access to a arger developer pool). A key takeaway for me was that these frameworks do give significant benefits to large teams able to invest and maintain in them. Smaller teams however, tend to get bogged down in their complexity the moment you go beyond the defaults. It's a bit like the &quot;blog in five minutes&quot; use cases that popped up all over the place when <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby On Rails</a> turned up 20 years ago. Of course RoR was truly revolutionary at the time and incredibly powerful, but the same was not true for other frameworks of the time.</p>
<p>In response, Laurie posted <a href="https://seldo.com/posts/the_case_for_frameworks">the case for frameworks</a> in support of React and JavaScript frameworks. His main argument, whilst acknowlegding certain failings of frameworks, is that you're OK because everyone is doing it. This is the 2020s reload of the &quot;no one ever got fired for picking IBM&quot; thinking in the 80s.</p>
<p>But are these frameworks as popular as they seem. Andy takes a look his post <a href="https://andy-bell.co.uk/the-extremely-loud-minority/">the (extremely) loud minority</a> and concludes &quot;not really&quot;. Obviously there are thousands of sites using React, but only 3.3% of the top 10 million websites actually use it. The percentage of all websites is probably much smaller. In comparison, Wordpress is used by 43.1% of the top 10 million websites. The reason these frameworks seem more popular than they actually is explained in <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/15011">dev perception</a> by Jeremy.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> is still used on over 77% of the top 10 million websites. 16 years after it's first release. It's popularity is only now starting to dip. There are many reasons for it's popularity.</p>
<p>One reason is that jQuery was released at a time when web standards were poorly supported by browsers. This meant developers had to write code for each of the common browsers at the time. jQuery provided a standardising layer, which enabled your code to work well in all browsers.</p>
<p>A second is that it was not released by a big tech company. jQuery was created by one guy, John Resig. Since there was no big company owning jQuery, other companies didn't feel the need to compete and release their own framework. There was no competition and it quickly became the defacto framework used by anyone programming front-end JavaScript.</p>
<p>A third reason is that jQuery was quite simple to get started with. You could sprinkle it lightly throughout your code, or you could base all your code around it.</p>
<p>The reason for it's recent dip: browsers are finally more or less equal in terms of standars support and the use case for jQuery is waning, especially in new projects.</p>
<p>All of this leads me to the actual point I want to make. It's about the most common framework, used by 100% of all websites. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldWideWeb">work in progress since 1990</a>. It is of course the browser using standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Sure, it doesn't always have the latest bells and whistles like, instead its future support is unparalled. It will never be obsolete.</p>
<p>You can't go wrong choosing it. In fact you can't avoid choosing it!</p>

        <p>Tuesday 7th February was <a href="https://www.saferinternetday.org/">Safer Internet Day</a> in 2023. It also marks the 20th year of the initiative, which is supported by the European Commission through the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/safer-internet-day">Safer Internet team of DG CONNECT</a>.</p>
<p>As part of that day, we arranged a morning in the <a href="https://www.lmrl.lu/">Lycee Michel-Rodange</a> in Luxembourg City, to let a class of the school try out the latest VR headsets from Meta. The kids, all around 15 years of age, got to try out five different VR worlds as they circulated around different stands in a class room. After that they had a brief discussion, giving their thoughts on VR in their futures.</p>
<p>It's been a long time since I was in a class room full of 15 year olds and it was incredibly energising. They were all well behaved, whilst having their fun with the headsets. Maybe that is the Luxembourg effect!</p>
<p>Best of all, in my opinion, was the lack of enthusiasm for this technology with these kids. Our polling showed they did not believe this technology would become an alternate world for them in the future. Whilst they saw the use of it in certain educational situations, few would be interested VR being their main medium of education. Despite growing up with always connected smartphones, they still apparently wanted face to face contact with their friends. They certainly didn't want to live in the VR world.</p>
<p>My own take on this, having tried out the headsets, is that they are simply not ready for the mainstream. The technology is too fiddly and, despite being relatively easy to use, is too cumbersome to do what appear to be basic things. I certainly can't see the advantage over a physical meeting with colleagues, or even a video-conference. There's still a long way to go before this tech can become mainstream. Maybe it never will, at least not in this form. And certainly not for entertainment or socialising purposes.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>By the end of this week my younger daughter has to have chosen the subjects she wants to study for her European Baccalaureate. For those in the UK, this is equivalent to choosing your A levels, but much more complicated. This i not to say that it is easier, since these are always difficult choices. Just that there are subjects that are compulsory and more rules about which combination of subjects are not allowed. The <a href="http://www.euroschool.lu/site/secondary-s6-s7-subject-choice-booklet/#1575669389394-aa74a39f-b3ba">exact rules can be found here</a>, but since that link is likely to break in the future, I recap them here.</p>
<h2>Compulsory subjects</h2>
<p>You must take a number of compulsory subjects, which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Language 1, 4 periods</li>
<li>Language 2, 3 periods</li>
<li>Maths: either 3 or 5 periods</li>
<li>Biology 2 periods
<ul>
<li>unless Biology, Physics or Chemisty are taken as 4 period subjects</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Geography 2 periods
<ul>
<li>unless taken as a 4 period subject</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>History 2 periods
<ul>
<li>unless taken as a 4 period subject</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Philiosophy 2 periods
<ul>
<li>unless taken as a 4 period subject</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ethics 1 period</li>
<li>Physical Education 2 periods</li>
</ul>
<h2>Optional subjects</h2>
<p>In addtion you must choose a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 4 optional 4 period subjects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Biology</li>
<li>Chemistry</li>
<li>Physics</li>
<li>Art</li>
<li>Music</li>
<li>Geography</li>
<li>History</li>
<li>Philosophy</li>
<li>Language 3</li>
<li>Economics or Latin</li>
<li>Language 4 or ONL (Other National Language)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Advanced subjects</h2>
<p>You can also choose one advanced subject from the three available (in addition to their normal level):</p>
<ul>
<li>Advanced Language 1</li>
<li>Advanced Language 2</li>
<li>Advanced Maths
<ul>
<li>Only if Maths 5 period is chosen</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From all of the above (compulsory, optional and advanced), you must have a minimum of 29 periods.</p>
<h2>Complementary subjects</h2>
<p>You can also choose a range of complementary subjects, which are 2 periods each. I won't list them all here except that ones that have conditions attached to them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Laboratory in Biology, Physics or Chemistry
<ul>
<li>You can only choose one of these and only if you are doing the equivalent 4 period subject</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Introduction to Economics
<ul>
<li>Cannot be chosen if you have chosen 4 period economics</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Total periods</h2>
<p>All of your chosen subjects must amount to at least 31 periods and maximum 35 periods. You can go slightly higher, but this needs permission from the school. You cannot go lower.</p>
<h2>Final exam choices</h2>
<p>All of the above has important ramnifications for the subjects you are examined in at the end of the Bac. All the subjects count towards your bac, but those you choose to be examined in count much more.</p>
<p>You cannot choose complementary subjects for these exams. If you choose one of the advanced subjects you must be examined in it. In addition there are written and oral exams, some of which cannot be the same.</p>
<p>For the written exams, of which you take five, your choices are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compulsory: Language 1 (or advanced if taken)</li>
<li>Compulsory: Language 2 (or advanced if taken)</li>
<li>Compulsory: Maths 3 or 5 period (depending on which you chose)</li>
<li>Choice from:
<ul>
<li>Two of the 4 period subjects you have chosen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition you cannot choose for the oral exams a subject you chose as one your choices for the 4 period subjects.</p>
<p>For the oral exams, of which you take three, your choices are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compulsory: Language 1 (or advanced if taken)</li>
<li>Choice from:
<ul>
<li>Language 2 (or advanced if taken)
<ul>
<li>Advanced is compulsory if chosen</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>History 2 or 4 periods</li>
<li>Geography 2 or 4 periods</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Choice from:
<ul>
<li>most of the other 4 period subjects, unless chosen as the second option above</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I explain all this because it means you might end up with no choices in the exams you have to take, depending on your subject choices for the bac. But understanding this can be quite complicated.</p>
<p>So I coded up a <a href="https://www.robin.is/assets/html/bac-choices.html">european bac subject toolkit</a> to help my daughter visualise the consequences of her subject choices on the final bac exams she will have to take.</p>
<h2>The Code</h2>
<p>I coded the entire toolkit without resorting to any frameworks or external scripts. These would have taken me much longer to learn than simply using vanilla JavaScript. What is good to see is how far in built browser support for lots of JavaScript functionality has come.  For this little toolkit using any kind of framework would have been complete overkill.</p>
