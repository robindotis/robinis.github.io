                This book took me much longer than it should have to read. It's
                interesting, but perhaps that is why I was not so captivated by
                it. If I had read it in a couple of days it might have been more
                meaningful. Still, the story of spacefaring humans making first
                contact with this planet of ice and snow is well worth reading.

              <p>
                Every now and then I am looking for a better editing experience
                for my website content. Currently I am simply editing the
                content either directly in GitHub or else in Visual Studio Code.
                This is fine, about the only inconvenience is dealing with image
                uploads: resizing, optimising and adding to the content. The
                last time I looked into a CMS was about
                <a href="/posts/2022/alternatives-to-forestry/">18 months ago</a
                >. My requirements from back then haven't really changed,
                although I am now willing to pay for the CMS if it is really
                going to simplify my life.
              </p>
              <p>
                Recently I have come across two open source projects which look
                promising:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><a href="https://pagescms.org/">Pages CMS</a></li>
                <li>
                  <a href="https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms">Sveltia</a>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                They are in fact quite similar and can be added to a website
                without needing a real host, they use netlify or cloudflare for
                the GitHub authentication parts, the rest is client side code.
                In fact Sveltia is a fork of
                <a href="https://decapcms.org/">Decap CMS</a>, which itself is a
                rebrand of the no longer supported Netlify CMS. Both do a nice
                job of putting a front end on the GitHub experience, but neither
                seems to fit in too well with my specificities out of the box
                (eg collections and assets that contain sub folders). Getting
                them to work through Cloudflare also takes some fiddling, but it
                does work in the end.
              </p>
              <p>
                I still miss <a href="https://tina.io/forestry/">Forestry</a>,
                which was replaced by <a href="http://Tina.io">Tina.io</a>, but
                that is too focussed on Next.js sites for my liking. I decided
                to give <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/">CloudCannon</a>,
                <a href="https://strapi.io/">Strapi</a> and
                <a href="https://www.sanity.io/">Sanity</a> another look. But
                they either had too many proprietary aspects (Sanity), needed to
                be self hosted (Strapi) or just not quite what I wanted
                (CloudCannon). I guess I will just have to stick with GitHub and
                VSC. No harm done.

              <h2>Day 1 - Arrival in Pisa</h2>
              <p>
                We arrived in Pisa on time, picked up the rental car and checked
                into the hotel around 3pm. The hotel, which belonged to the
                <a href="https://www.hotel-bb.com/en">B&amp;B Hotels</a> chain,
                did not feel like one. Our room &quot;with terrace&quot; was on
                the 5th floor, which had to be reached by stairs from the 4th
                floor. The terrace was rusty and uninviting. The whole thing
                seemed like an afterthought. This is not the usual basic but
                solid standard we expected from that chain.
              </p>
              <p>
                After a rest we headed to Pisa by taxi, which at around 18 Euros
                was not too pricey and saved the headache and cost of parking.
                Just in front of the Univerity of Pisa, where none other than
                Galieo Galilei studied, there was Renault 5 tuning exibition.

                of people taking photos of themselves propping up the tower.

                just round the corner of the Renault 5 meet and late evening
                stroll along the river.

                  >National Museum of San Matteo</a
                >
                which was intersting and made a nice quiet respite from the heat
                and the tourists! I particularly liked this painting by Quentin
                Metsys.

              </p>
              <p>
                We followed that with a walk around the
                <a href="https://museodellagrafica.sma.unipi.it/"
                  >Museo della Grafica Palazzo Lanfranchi</a

              </p>
              <p>
                Finally at the end of a tiring day, we sat down for dinner in
                one of the tourist traps along the pedestrian zone. As expected,
                it was not great. If you want nice food, keep away from the Via
                Santa Maria.

              <h2>Day 3 - Volterra and Siena</h2>
              <p>On day three we drove to Siena, via a stopover in Volterra.</p>
              <p>

              </p>
              <p>
                We had a lovely amble around town, visiting the Etruscan museum.
                This was interesting, but got rather repetitive as it ended up
                being just etruscan urn after etruscan urn. A bit like doom
                scrolling on TikTok...
              </p>
              <p>
                The Roman Amphitheatre was nice, although not as nice as the one
                we are used to in Plovdiv. We had a nice lunch in an
                <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/6vNr5NqT1rfmKi6X8"
                  >Irish pub</a
                >
                doubling up as a pizzeria during the day for the tourists.

              </p>
              <p>
                We finished off by having a look at the Medici Fortress, which
                is not really a tourist attraction, but a medium security
                prison. Wandering into an open door, we almost got locked in as
                it started to automatially close behind us!

              </p>
              <p>
                We then headed to our apartment in Siena, the wonderful
                <a href="https://hotelsienaborgogrondaie.com/"
                  >Borgo Grondaie</a
                >
                and had a reasonable pizza in the
                <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/6wKrq2tgxyQepxgF9"
                  >I Gabellieri</a
                >. It was pouring down with rain when left the pizzeria.
                Thankfully that was the last of the really wet weather.
              </p>
              <h2>Day 4 - Siena</h2>
              <p>
                After a slow start to the day and a lunch in the apartment we
                headed to Siena, leaving the car in the Fortress parking. Siena
                is very impressive, much more so than Florence. The Campo Plaza,
                the medieval central square at the centre of town is a view to
                behold.
              </p>
              <p>

              </p>
              <p>
                Nearby is also the magnificent Duomo de Siena, who's interior is
                as wonderful as the exterior. You can also pay to climb some
                nearby walls in order to look at the Dome and Siena from above.
                It's a wonderful sight.

              </p>
              <p>
                Ambling around a bit more, when ended up having a rather
                dissapointing dinner at the Shangai restaurant in town. It did
                make a change from Italian pizza and pasta though.
              </p>
              <p>
                We headed back to the apartment in the evening, for a nice glass
                of local wine in the gardens of the hotel.
              </p>
              <h2>Day 5 - Val D'Orcia, Pienza and Terme Rapolano</h2>
              <p>
                We drove to Pienza, through the beautiful countryside of the Val
                D'Orcia and some stormy weather. The town has stunning views
                over the rolling hills of the valley.

              </p>
              <p>
                Walked around the town a little, looking for lunch, but instead
                stumbled through the crew setting up a film shoot. Apparently
                George Clooney and Adam Sandler are starring in the film. But we
                didn't want to hang around too much as the clouds were looking
                ominous, so we headed off quite soon and rove to Terme Rapolano,
                again through a few rain showers.
              </p>
              <p>
                In Terme Rapolano we stayed for a couple of hours in the San
                Giovanni Spa which was lovely, including an infinity pool
                looking out over the beautiful countryside.
              </p>
              <h2>Day 6 - Florence</h2>
              <p>
                After a late start to the day, we drove to Florence, parking at
                <a href="https://parcheggiovillacostanza.it/en/"
                  >Villa Costanza</a
                >. This is a really well thought out parking allowing tourists
                to drive to the outskirts of town and then get the tram into the
                centre. The tram ride took about 25 minutes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once in Florence, we saw usual wonderful things, the Cathedral,
                Palazzio Vecchio, Ufizi gallery (including paintings by
                Botticelo, Michelangleo, Leonardo) and the Ponte Vecchio. Lunch
                was a terrible affair and I almost had my bag nabbed.

                As lovely as Florence is, there's just too many tourists there
                to make it enjoyable. Of course we were tourists ourselves, so
                we can't complain. Having had enough of the crowds we headed
                back to parking on the tram and drove home in the evening.
              </p>
              <h2>Day 7 - Spa San Giovanni again</h2>
              <p>
                This was our last full day, so we had a lazy morning doing very
                little. We did go to the shop to get products for lunch and we
                did some preparatory packing. In the afternoon we headed off to
                the Spa Giovanni again for another relaxing afternoon. This time
                we put on sunscreen so we could catch a tan. Of course it was
                cloudy with the odd drips of rain. But that did not distract
                from the relaxing time at the spa.
              </p>
              <h2>Day 8 - Return to Pisa and flight home</h2>
              <p>
                In the morning of our last day we drove off to Pisa airport. I
                had set Google to take me to a petrol station not too far from
                the airport, so that I could fuel up the car before dropping it
                off at the car rental. Google having a mind of it's own, sent me
                up a dirt track to get to the petrol station. Expecting me to
                walk the last 100 metres. Great.
              </p>
              <p>
                Anyway, all is well that ends well. We got to the airport,
                dropped off the car, got on the plane and returned home no
                problem. Two days later I had Covid!
