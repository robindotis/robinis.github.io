        <p>Having enjoyed last year's <a href="/posts/2023/rock-werchter-2023/">day at Rock Werchter</a> so much, we got to tickets to see <a href="https://redhotchilipeppers.com/">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a> at <a href="https://www.rockwerchter.be/en/">Rock Werchter 2023</a> this year.</p>
<h2>The Black Keys</h2>
<p>Since it was a work day, we only got there around 6.30pm and first up were the Black Keys. They were not really our thing, but it was a good start to the evening.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2023/black-keys.webp" alt="The Black Keys playing on the Main stage"></p>
<h2>The Hu</h2>
<p>Whilst waiting for Liam Gallagher to appear on the main stage, we walked around a little and caught the last few minutes of <a href="https://www.thehuofficial.com/music">The Hu</a> on the Klub C stage. They are a monogolian rock / techno / group whom I did not know before and they were great. I will have to find another show of theirs!</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2023/the-hu.webp" alt="The Hu playing on the Klub C stage"></p>
<h2>Pup</h2>
<p>Then we ambled over to the Slope where we watched Canadian group <a href="https://www.puptheband.com/">Pup</a> for about 15 minutes, who were also good fun whith fantastic music. Interestingly the Slope had been turned around so it faced the stage, rather than the stage being underneath it!</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2023/pup.webp" alt="Pup playing on the Slope stage"></p>
<h2>Liam Gallagher</h2>
<p>We returned to the main stage to watch <a href="https://www.liamgallagher.com/home/">Liam Gallagher</a> play, but we were not impressed. Nor were the crowd I don't think. Oasis were great in their day and their songs are still fantastic. But on stage, Liam was very poor and lifeless. I realise that is his thing, but times have changed and I think crowds expect more of a <a href="http://show.It">show.It</a> didn't help that he completely failed to build up a connection with the crowd - his arrogant appearance and inuendos not really making an impact. You're not in Manchester, Liam, it's Rock Werchter!</p>

<h2>Red Hot Chili Peppers</h2>
<p>We hung around near the front of the Main stage for an hour, until Red Hot Chili Peppers were on at 23:30. We were thinking of getting into the enclosure right in front of the stage, but decided not to. So we watched them from the &quot;second row&quot; as it were. They were great!</p>

        <h2>by Alain de Botton</h2>
<p>An interesting read about how basic human psychology affects the daily life of all of us in much the same way. We shouldn't take the actions of others personally. Rather, we should think of them as reaction to the inner problems of others. Probably we should have pity on them.</p>
<p>Likewise all our freakish, perverted and non-sensical thoughts are actually perfectly normal. Everyone has similar thoughts going through their heads more or less all the same time. It's not just us. Our worries and anxietes? It's not just us, it's everyone.</p>
<p>This sentence from the end of the book is a good summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are all, where it counts, steering almost blind</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or as I like to think of it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Almost everyone, almost of the time, is just winging it</p>
</blockquote>

        <p>I started watching a Netflix series called <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8421350/">Manifest</a> back in Summer last year. Today I completed watching it after they released the final 10 episodes a few days ago.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my <a href="/posts/2022/manifest/">previous post on the series</a>, the series got a bit repetitive with the heroes following calling after calling without any real or obvious development towards an end. Nevertheless I wanted to see the conclusion of this story.</p>
<details>
    <summary>Spoiler Alert!</summary>
<p>Well, given the tendency for happy endings in Hollywood this one was not hard to guess in advance. The plane returns back where it came from and lands as it should have done in 2013. Whilst the passengers on the plane still know what has happened, those greeting them do not. Which leads to an interesting final few minutes as the individual story lines are wrapped up with what the passengers learned along the way.</p>
<p>Of course, nowadays no series ends without a chance for a spin off. Those passengers who could not redeem themselves in the five and half years during which they were gone have disappeared from the plane. The series ends with the same FBI agent who was the lead in investigating the dissapearance of the plane, now turning up to investigate the dissapearance of the 11 missing passengers.</p>
