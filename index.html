        <p>We were up in Pamporovo recently, staying at the lovely <a href="https://malina-pamporovo.com/en/">Villa Malina</a>. I don't ski, so I've never really seen ski pistes in the winter. There was no snow at all in the surrounding mountains. Yet a piste was there, created with artificial snow and being used by a lot of skiers. I know know how they market these things.</p>
<h2>The marketing blurb</h2>

        <p>Discworld author Terry Pratchett died in 2015. His books were hugely popular, making him one of the most successfull authors of all time. To remember him, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discworld/comments/2yt9j6/gnu_terry_pratchett/">group of redditers</a> came up with the idea of implementing the clacks  system from the book Going Postal in today's internet. This can done by adding the following bit of code to the <code>head</code> tag in any HTML file:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;X-Clacks-Overhead&quot; content=&quot;GNU Terry Pratchett&quot; /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>It can also be implemented by configuring web servers to send an appropriate page header. In fact this is the better option, but I am not able to configure the web server, as I am using GitHub Pages to host the site.</p>
<p>I had implemented this years ago, whilst I still had my site running on Wordpress. After moving to a static site, I had forgotten about this and not added the clacks meta tag. Well, now it's back - just in time for the new year!</p>
<p>More information on the clacks headers is available here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gnuterrypratchett.com/">http://www.gnuterrypratchett.com/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The site also lists a number of plugins which can notify you if you are visiting a site which has implemented the clacks header.</p>

        <h2>by Iain M Banks</h2>
<p>One of the easier to read culture novels. Told in an intersting way and without a predictable outcome whilst reading it, nor a clear answer to who did (or didn't) do it. What continues to impress is the way Iain M Banks is able to really drill home timeless infinity that defines our galaxy and the universe beyond it.</p>
<p>The culture, whilst one of the more advanced and expansive civilisations in the galaxy, are portrayed as really just in their mid-20s. Very clever and important, but really not quite able to compete with those even more advanced.</p>
