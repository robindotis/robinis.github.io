          <p>This morning, walking Angie in one of the locations we rarely go to, Angie disappeared. I was walking ahead as usual, she was dilly dallying at the back. When I retraced my steps to go and find her, she was gone. After about half an hour of whistling and shouting I started to get quite worried. I went back to the car to see if she was there, then I called my wife to come back from work to help find her. I also called a nearby neighbour who I know from walking our dogs. She came and helped look with her dog, Tashi. But all to no good. She phoned her bedsitter to check if Angie had returned to our house. No luck.</p>
<p>The neighbour went back to the village, and opened the gate to our garden so Angie could go in, if she returned. At that time my wife had returned home as well and between them half the village was now looking for Angie.</p>
<p>In the meantime I went back to my car and drove down the hill to the houses below where we were walking. This was about 90 minutes after she went missing. Walking around there, a lady came out of one of the houses, asking if I was looking for a dog. I said yes, and she mentioned that another lady, a teacher, had found a dog and put her in her van and gone to work at the school. The teacher had given the lady her phone number. So I got in touch with the teacher and started heading to the school she worked at.</p>
<p>It turns out the teacher had already posted a message on Facebook which our direct neighbour had already seen, recognised Angie, contacted the teacher separately and was heading to the school with my wife. I followed along and we were reunited with Angie about two and half hours after she went missing. They'd even cleaned her! I guess dirty dogs are not allowed in schools.</p>
<p>It is very nice to see how quickly things can come together when everyone helps - and how social media can actually be put to good use as well from time to time!</p>
<p>And that is my Christmas Tale for 2023. üéÖüéÑ</p>

        <div class="e-content">
          <p>I decided to make my website installable, so it can be added to a device as an installed application. The way to do this is to add some javascript to the site so that it is a Progressive Web App (PWA).</p>
<p>To be a PWA, a website needs only one thing: a <a href="https://web.dev/learn/pwa/service-workers/">service worker</a>. Adding one is fairly straightforward, once you know how. It does require a good understanding of asynchronous JavaScript, something which I struggle with. The alternative is just to copy someone else's service worker code and adapt if needed. I chose the alternative. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
<p>So I copied the one from <a href="https://adactio.com/">Jeremy Keith</a>. It took me a while to get it to work, although I am not sure I really changed anything very much. However, debugging PWAs is more complex than plain JavaScript. So most of my efforts were trial and error. And then it worked. Magic! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
<p>I even managed to get an <a href="/offline/">offline page</a> working for the PWA. Again, copied from <a href="https://adactio.com/offline">Jeremy's offline page</a>. What this page does, thanks to some nifty JavaScript, is check if there is a network connection. If there is it fetches the page from the server. If there isn't, it tries to fetch the page from the cache. If the page has not been cached, it displays a list of pages that have been cached and are therefore available for offline reading. Fantastic!</p>

          <h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>One of the challenges, at least for me, in modern web development, is keeping track of dependencies. On the one hand they help you avoid reinventing the wheel. On the otherhand they can cause unexpected problems which are sometimes hard to diagnose. I like to keep them to a minimum, especially when I don't really understand how they do what they do.</p>
<p>So, I improved my GitHub action that builds my <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">eleventy</a> based website by removing my dependency on an <a href="https://github.com/TartanLlama/actions-eleventy">action from a GitHub user called TartanLlama</a>. This action used a Docker file to build and generate the actual HTML pages for the website. The action has served me well for the last three years, but I did worry about what would happen if there was a bug and the user stopped maintaining this bit of code. It had stopped working once and it took me a couple of days to realise that I had to update my link to the action to a newer version. I didn't want to end up in <a href="/posts/2022/dependency/">this situation</a>, should the user decide to call it a day.</p>
<p>So I did some Googling and found <a href="https://www.rockyourcode.com/how-to-deploy-eleventy-to-github-pages-with-github-actions/">this blog post</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/75599084">this answer on Stack Overflow</a>. (<a href="/posts/2023/stackoverflow/">Yes, I know I am trying to avoid Stack Overflow</a>, but Google makes it very hard!). Between the two, I came up with this step in my GitHub action:</p>
<pre><code>- name: Install dependencies &amp; build
    run: |
        npm install --package-lock-only
        npm ci
        npm run build  
</code></pre>
