          <p>More for fun than any other reason, I like to keep my site as close to possible to 100 on <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/">Lighthouse</a> and <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/">PageSpeed Insights</a>. For most of the metrics I am in the green, at or close to 100%.</p>
<p>On some pages, normally those with many images, I struggle with &quot;Largest Contentful Paint&quot; (LCP). I am not sure there is much I can do about this as I am dependent on GitHub for how long it takes to load the images. I could try optimising the images further, but they are already resized to 800px and saved in WEBP format. Probably they could be smaller when viewed on mobiles, but I really can't be bothered at the moment with managing different sized versions of the same image. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
<p>However, I then noticed that my site was nearly always failing on &quot;Cumulative Layout Shift&quot; (CLP), including pages without images. This I found strange because <a href="/about/">my site uses next to no JavaScript</a> or other trickery, so why should there be a layout shift on pages which are pure text? It turns out the problem is my use of web fonts. Whilst the browser loads the font file, it displays the page in the system's default font. When it then applies the web font a short time later, this will affect the layout of the text, which then shifts. The <a href="https://simonhearne.com/2021/layout-shifts-webfonts/">solution to this problem</a> is to use <code>font-display: optional</code> instead of <code>font-display: swap</code>. This avoids the font swap if the web fonts are not loaded fast enough. It means on the first view, the user might not view the site in my intended font. But by the second view, the font file will have been cached and the web font will kick in.</p>
<p>My CLP went from a quarter of a second to a few hundreds of a second. Magic! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

          <h2>by William Gibson</h2>
<p>A collection of short stories by William Gibson. Some based around the Neuromancer world, others unrelated. I found a few quite abstract and unclear, making it  hard to understand the story. Others were great.</p>
<h3>Johnny Mnemonic</h3>
<p>A great read - they made a film of this one, starring Keanu Reeves. It's about a person who can securely store other's private data in his brain so that only they can access it. This one is based in the same universe as the Neuromancer triology.</p>
<h3>The Gernsback Continuum</h3>
<p>An odd one. Somewhat tricky to follow.</p>
<h3>Fragments of a Hologram rose</h3>
<p>A very short story, again rather abstract.</p>
<h3>The Belonging Kid</h3>
<p>About aliens mingling amongst humans on earth. An interesting read.</p>
<h3>Hinterlands</h3>
<p>A really interesting story about a sort of tunnel to another galaxy or universe. One of my favourites in this collection.</p>
<h3>Red Star, Winter Orbit</h3>
<p>Another fascinating story about a Russian space station inhabited by civilians called Kosmograd. One of them, the first person to walk on Mars, has been in space for 20 years and can't return. Then Russia decides to pull the plug.</p>
<h3>New Rose Hotel</h3>
<p>Back in the Neuromancer cyberpunk world, dealing with gloabl corporations figthing for scientists at the very &quot;edge&quot; of research into bio technology. Two spies help these scientists in dealing with these corporations. It deals with the exact same topic of the Neuromancer trilogoy and was released at the same time. It seems like he was testing the water with this one.</p>
<h3>The Winter Market</h3>
<p>This story deals with making recordings of people's thoughts and then selling them as entertainment.</p>
<h3>Dogfight</h3>
<p>About a loner with a criminal past wanting to make his next million by beating the top dog at a computer game that is played through being jacked into a headset type thing.</p>
<h3>Burning Chrome</h3>
<p>The story that started it all, where the term &quot;cyperspace&quot; was first coined. It only uses the term once, in the second sentence of the first paragraph. It does so almost in passing and it is otherwise unremarkable in the context of the story. But there it is: &quot;cyberspace&quot;.</p>
<p>The story itself is an interesting one, setting the scene for Neuromancer and it's two follow up stories. It deals with two guys essentially doing a bank heist. One to impress a girl, the other to get the money. The clue is that term coined by William Gibson. The heist happens in cyberspace!</p>
<p>Started 13/02/2024. Finished 19/02/2024.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
          <p>After a nice few days in <a href="/posts/2024/barcelona/">Barcelona</a>, we took a high speed iryo train to Madrid. Travelling at up to 300km/h we covered the over 600km journey in about two hours and 45 minutes, including a brief stop in Zaragoza.</p>
<p>We arrived at the central station, Puerta de Atocha, around 15:30. We then took a <a href="https://www.renfe.com/es/es/cercanias">Cercanias</a> local train, which was included in our ticket from Barcelona, to get to the airport terminal T4 and then took the 827 bus to Barajas. We walked the remaining five minutes to our hotel,  Hotel Clement, arriving around 18:00.</p>
<p>Having checked in, we went out to get some food, settling on a Nepalese place, as everything else was booked out due to it being valentines day. The food was good.</p>
<p>The next day we headed into town with a friend who gave us a good walking tour around Madrid. We started off at Place d'Espanya with a statue of Cervantes in the middle and surrounded by rather grandiose and imposing buildings.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2024/madrid-1.webp" alt=""></p>
<p>Next we headed up the Gran Via to Plaza del Callao and on to Puerta del Sol. This is the starting point in Madrid for all distances to other towns, kilometre zero.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2024/madrid-3.webp" alt=""><br>
<img src="/assets/images/2024/madrid-2.webp" alt=""></p>
<p>We carried on to Plaza Mayor. The name is similar to Brussels' Grande Place, but the looks are quite different.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2024/madrid-4.webp" alt=""><br>
<img src="/assets/images/2024/madrid-5.webp" alt=""></p>
<p>We then headed onto Mercado de San Miguel...</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2024/madrid-6.webp" alt=""></p>
<p>...before reaching the Royal Palace.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2024/madrid-7.webp" alt=""></p>
<p>These are statues of the previous spanish kings.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2024/madrid-8.webp" alt=""></p>
<p>It was time for a late lunch, before continuing in the direction of the Prado and a quick look at Place de Colon.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2024/madrid-9.webp" alt=""></p>
<p>Finally we reached the Prado, which has free entry after 6pm. You need more than the two hours this affords you to cover the whole museum. But I looked at some of the Cervantes paintings, as well as the famous Dos de Mayo and Tres de Mayo paintings. I also spotted the painting of a lady squirting breast milk into a priest's mouth, one which I had noticed over 20 years ago on my <a href="/posts/2001/spain/">last visit to Madrid</a>. But did not spot the painting by Bosch that I noted at the time. Maybe it was on loan to somewhere else. Or maybe it was not actually by Bosch.</p>
<p>The following day I was ill so I didn't do a lot, whilst the other went out. The next morning we flew back to Luxembourg. Not without a minor panic though. For whatever reason my younger daughter's wallet, including ID card, was with my older daughter. Only problem was that we were flying from different terminals at opposite ends of the airport! We realised this at check-in. Thankfully a) the airport has an efficient transfer bus between the two terminals every five minutes and b) my older daughter's flight was an hour later. On the other hand she had already gone through security. Still she found her way out of the Terminal, to the transfer bus, brought us the wallet and saved the day. No one missed their flight! üôÇ</p>
<p>One interesting thing in Spain seem to be that you are charged extra (a three Euro supplement per person) to take the metro to the airport. It means for a family of four this 12 Euros on top of the actual metro ticket. So you are easily looking at 20 Euro. An Uber is not much more to some locations from the airport. This makes no sense, I thought policy was to encourage taking public transport. This seems to discourage it.</p>
