          <h2>by Marc Andreessen</h2>
<p>Source: <a href="https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/">The Techno-Optimist Manifesto</a></p>
<p>Note: compare to Communist Manifesto.</p>
<h2>Lies</h2>
<p>This whole intro is a lie. We are not being told any of these things. We are told to be weary of thechnology, to treat it with respect. With great power comes great responsibility.</p>
<h2>Truth</h2>
<p>Indeed, except I didn't realise the technology flag had been lowered.</p>
<h2>Technology</h2>
<p>Hmm...  I agree with a lot of this. But he misses some major points.</p>
<p>We have a problem of poverty, so we invent technology to create abundance.</p>
<p>Abundance for some, but at the moment this abundance is being wasted by the few rather than put to good use for the many.</p>
<p>We believe this is why our descendents will live in the stars.</p>
<p>The question is, can we live in the stars before we use up all the resources on the planet. We haven't yet turned the corner on wasting resources.</p>
<h2>Markets</h2>
<p>Markets prevent monopolies and cartels.</p>
<p>No they dont't. Plenty of monopolies in the world, also in the free capitalist world.</p>
<p>We believe markets are an inherently individualistic way to achieve superior collective outcomes.</p>
<p>You can believe that. Some people believe the earth is flat. It doesn't make it true. Where's the evidence for such a statement.</p>
<p>We believe the ultimate moral defense of markets is that they divert people who otherwise would raise armies and start religions into peacefully productive pursuits.</p>
<p>Only if the spoils of the markets are fairly distributed. Not the case at the moment.</p>
<p>We believe markets are the way to generate societal wealth for everything else we want to pay for, including basic research, social welfare programs, and national defense.</p>
<p>Why would we need social welfare programs if the markets actually worked?</p>
<p>Why would we need national defense, if we wereliving in the stars?</p>
<p>We believe a Universal Basic Income would turn people into zoo animals to be farmed by the state.</p>
<p>This I kind of agree with.</p>
<p>Man was not meant to be farmed; man was meant to be useful, to be productive, to be proud.</p>
<p>Hmmm, useful to whom? Productive for what? We were not <strong>meant</strong> to be anything, we simply <strong>are</strong>.</p>
<p>Being proud probably helps though.</p>
<p>There are a lot of valid points in this section. But since he is saying markets support the welfare state, then they must be taxed and regulated, otherwise how will this support work. Not quite the free markets he is intending. Or else we understand different things in &quot;free markets&quot;.</p>
<h2>The Techno-Capital Machine</h2>
<p>Whole section reads like a description of Iain M Banks' <a href="https://www.robin.is/archive/tagged/iain-banks/">Culture Series</a>.</p>
<p>Of course that is science fiction and doesn't have to deal with the limited resources on planet earth. Nevermind the limits of physics and the physiology of our bodies.</p>
<p>I can't help feeling that &quot;accelerationism&quot; as he calls it, doesn't quite lead to what he thinks. Acceleration tends to stretch things. If you are not careful, the link between those at the front doing the pulling (the few super rich), and those at the back being pulled along (the poor), risks breaking. We could end up living in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elysium_(film)">Elysium</a> style &quot;utopia&quot;.</p>
<h2>Intelligence</h2>
<p>Intelligence is inate. But being smart needs high quality education. Limiting high quality education to the rich, as is increasingly happening now, means the compound effect of &quot;intelligence * education&quot; is being woefully exploited. Since intelligence is inate, it is equally spread through the population. But when only one segment of the population gets to use that intelligence, you are missing out on an awful lot of intelligence.</p>
<p>A lot of this chapter was like &quot;what is this guy on&quot;:</p>
<p>as people form symbiotic relationships with machines into new cybernetic systems such as companies and networks;</p>
<p>Of course AI can and is beneficial, but only because it is powered by human intelligence.</p>

          <p>Today I implemented some of the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a> <a href="https://indieweb.org/">building blocks</a>.</p>
<p>First I added <a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieAuth">IndieAuth</a> with GitHub account, testing it against the <a href="https://indielogin.com/api">IndieLogin</a> service.</p>
<p>Next I added the required meta tags for <a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention">webmentions</a> using the <a href="https://webmention.io/">webmention.io</a> service to receive webmentions and pingbacks. Not that anyone is ever reading my blog or that I process the mentions... Still the site is setup for this.</p>
<p>Then I added a <a href="https://indieweb.org/microformats">microformat</a> <a href="https://indieweb.org/h-card">h-card</a> to my homepage in order to have business card like functionality on the web.</p>
<p>Finally, to wrap it all up, I added myself to the <a href="https://indieweb.org/indiewebring">IndieWebRing</a>, taking the lead from <a href="https://jasm1nii.xyz/">jasmine</a> and <a href="https://vanderven.se/martijn/">Martin van der van</a> on how to setup my h-card.</p>
<p>Having got started with microformats for the h-card, I went and added the required properties for <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry#Core_Properties">h-entry</a> as well.</p>

          <p>A nice rock concert at Rockhal on Sunday evening, watching Polish band <a href="https://www.riversideband.pl/en/">Riverside</a>, supported by Dutch group <a href="https://lesoirmusic.com/home/">Lesoir</a>.</p>
<h2>Lesoir</h2>
<p>The support act, Lesoir, were good, with some nice songs. I felt they struggled a little to connect with the audience.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2023/riverside-1.webp" alt=""></p>
<h2>Riverside</h2>
<p>Riverside were fantastic and put on a great show for the audience. The lead vocalist had a dry sense of humour which added to the atmosphere. No they are not like Dream Theatre, or Anathema. 64 members of the audience were from Luxembourg, the rest from elsewhere.</p>
