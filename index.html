          <h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>One of the challenges, at least for me, in modern web development, is keeping track of dependencies. On the one hand they help you avoid reinventing the wheel. On the otherhand they can cause unexpected problems which are sometimes hard to diagnose. I like to keep them to a minimum, especially when I don't really understand how they do what they do.</p>
<p>So, I improved my GitHub action that builds my <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">eleventy</a> based website by removing my dependency on an <a href="https://github.com/TartanLlama/actions-eleventy">action from a GitHub user called TartanLlama</a>. This action used a Docker file to build and generate the actual HTML pages for the website. The action has served me well for the last three years, but I did worry about what would happen if there was a bug and the user stopped maintaining this bit of code. It had stopped working once and it took me a couple of days to realise that I had to update my link to the action to a newer version. I didn't want to end up in <a href="/posts/2022/dependency/">this situation</a>, should the user decide to call it a day.</p>
<p>So I did some Googling and found <a href="https://www.rockyourcode.com/how-to-deploy-eleventy-to-github-pages-with-github-actions/">this blog post</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/75599084">this answer on Stack Overflow</a>. (<a href="/posts/2023/stackoverflow/">Yes, I know I am trying to avoid Stack Overflow</a>, but Google makes it very hard!). Between the two, I came up with this step in my GitHub action:</p>
<pre><code>- name: Install dependencies &amp; build
    run: |
        npm install --package-lock-only
        npm ci
        npm run build  
</code></pre>

          <h2>William Gibson</h2>
<p>Over the years I'd heard a lot about this book. The author coined the term &quot;cyberspace&quot; and basically invented the cyberpunk genre. Back in the early 80s. So I finally decided I should read it and it made a very suitable follow up to the <a href="/posts/2023/androids-sheep/">previous book</a> I read.</p>
<p>It's a fun read. I can see why it is so popular and how it would be a genre defining book. Very timely as well, with the rise of AI over the last year or two. Although that AI is nothing compared to what is described in this story. In fact the book is a suitable reminder that what we consider as AI right now, is nothing of the sort. It's certainly not intelligent, let alone self-aware.</p>
<p>I finished the last quarter of the book in one evening. On putting it down and thinking about it for a while, there were more questions than answers. But the one thought which I couldn't get out of my mind, is that this was basically a blue print for <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/">The Matrix</a>. Reading other people's thoughts on the web, I am clearly not the only one who came to this conclusion.</p>
<p>Apparently this book is part of a trilogoy. I guess they'll be my next two reads.</p>

          <p>So I deleted all my accounts on stack overlfow and the other stack exchange sites. Why? I hadn't posted a question on the site in over 10 years as I no longer program very much and I find the answer increasingly less relevant when I am looking for something.</p>
<p>I've also come to understand  how its kudos system has a lot of negative side effects, turning what should be a friendly Q&amp;A site into an agressively moderated online environment which is especially toxic to newbies who don't understand the rules. I had noticed myself that answers I gave over a decade ago were constantly re-edited and &quot;improved&quot;. Some questions I asked got completely rewritten or marked as duplicate even though I felt they weren't. This is the effect of members chasing kudos points in order to stay relevant in site's user rankings.</p>
<p>I have also noticed that all search engines rely heavily, almost exclusively, on Stack Overflow to provide answers to programming questions asked to them. The problem which arises, is that the best answer from 10 years ago may no longer actually be the best answer. This is especially the case in web design where accepted best practice has moved on so much that an answer from 10 years ago is often simply no longer relevant. However, because the answer was edited 2 years ago the search engines still think it is up to date. This leads me to believe that the whole Q&amp;A ecosystem created by Stack Overflow reeks of gaming the system. To the detriment of the user.</p>
<p>And I think the founders knew this. They <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/06/02/prosus-acquires-stack-overflow/">sold the site for a cool $1.8 billion</a> a couple of years ago, back in 2021. I think they realised they'd pushed this as far as they could and in the long term further growth would be difficult. The new owners will for sure make a good profit over the coming years, it is after all <em><strong>the</strong></em> go to site for programming answers. But I doubt the next 15 years will match the success of the previous 15 years.  I can't see it maintaining its relevance, especially in this age of AI and tools like Copilot.</p>
<p>In any case, I for one, intend to avoid the stack exchange network as much as I can in future.</p>
