          <p>On the 6th March those companies that have been designated as &quot;gatekeepers&quot; under the European Commission's <a href="https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/index_en">Digital Market Act</a> (DMA), need to finally comply with it.</p>
<p>The DMA has two intersting effects for web, both affecting Apple. Firstly, it forces Apple to allow alternate application stores to the one owned by Apple. Secondly, it also forces Apple to allow browser engines other than its own WebKit to be installed on iOS devices. Apple, as any cooperation worth its salt does, has taken these rules and interpreted them in the most mean spirited manner possible beyond simply not implementing the new rules at all.</p>
<p>A lot has already noted about Apples implementation of the first effect allowing alternate application stores. This has been largely covered in more business orientated publications due the Core Technology Fee it will charge to all installations not done through Apple's AppStore.</p>
<p>For those of us interested in an open web, one where mobile apps are not needed in order to offer relatively basic functionality, of far more significance is Apple's approach to the second requirement: allow third party browser engines to run on iOS. Apple's implementation in dealing with this is to basically break Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) for those who are in the EU. As much as Apple fears alternative application stores, it fears an open web even more. One in which they have no control over which applications can be run on an iOS device and by control I mean profit from.</p>
<p>Advocating for an open web, means I have signed this <a href="https://letter.open-web-advocacy.org/">open letter to Apple</a>. I encourage you to do the same. For more information on this issue, read <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/apple-attempts-killing-webapps/">this article from Open Web Advocacy</a> as well as <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/02/home-screen-advantage/">this one from Alex Russell</a>. Note that Alex works for Microsoft, so whilst his points are still valid, they might not be fully impartial.</p>
<p>The Commmission's decision is eagerly awaited in March.</p>

          <p>More for fun than any other reason, I like to keep my site as close to possible to 100 on <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/">Lighthouse</a> and <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/">PageSpeed Insights</a>. For most of the metrics I am in the green, at or close to 100%.</p>
<p>On some pages, normally those with many images, I struggle with &quot;Largest Contentful Paint&quot; (LCP). I am not sure there is much I can do about this as I am dependent on GitHub for how long it takes to load the images. I could try optimising the images further, but they are already resized to 800px and saved in WEBP format. Probably they could be smaller when viewed on mobiles, but I really can't be bothered at the moment with managing different sized versions of the same image. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
<p>However, I then noticed that my site was nearly always failing on &quot;Cumulative Layout Shift&quot; (CLP), including pages without images. This I found strange because <a href="/about/">my site uses next to no JavaScript</a> or other trickery, so why should there be a layout shift on pages which are pure text? It turns out the problem is my use of web fonts. Whilst the browser loads the font file, it displays the page in the system's default font. When it then applies the web font a short time later, this will affect the layout of the text, which then shifts. The <a href="https://simonhearne.com/2021/layout-shifts-webfonts/">solution to this problem</a> is to use <code>font-display: optional</code> instead of <code>font-display: swap</code>. This avoids the font swap if the web fonts are not loaded fast enough. It means on the first view, the user might not view the site in my intended font. But by the second view, the font file will have been cached and the web font will kick in.</p>
<p>My CLP went from a quarter of a second to a few hundreds of a second. Magic! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

          <h2>by Danny Dorling</h2>
<p>Interesting read about the very inequality of the UK - the highest in Europe except for Bulgaria. Quite depressing.</p>
<p>The Beveridge report which lead to the creation of the NHS wanted to get rid of the five evils:</p>
<ul>
<li>want ‚Äì an adequate income for all</li>
<li>disease ‚Äì access to health care</li>
<li>ignorance ‚Äì a good education</li>
<li>squalor ‚Äì adequate housing</li>
<li>idleness ‚Äì gainful employment</li>
</ul>
<p>By the 1970s this had been achieved to quite astonishing degree. Policies since then, from all political parties, have brough them back in a different form:</p>
<ul>
<li>hunger</li>
<li>precarity</li>
<li>waste</li>
<li>exploitation</li>
<li>fear</li>
</ul>
<p>Some very good points made about the ruling classes being completely out of touch with rest of the population. eg something 80% of economics students (the ones creating policies to alleviate things like hunger) are from privileged background. Only veterinary science has a higher percentage.</p>
<p>Or this paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The price mechanism works quite well for goods such as clothes because there are few monopoly supplies and people become quite expert at buying clothes as they do it often. People rarely become expert at buying a university education or a heart operation.</p>
