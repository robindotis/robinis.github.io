            <p>
              We arrived in Paris late afternoon on Saturday.
              <a href="https://www.hotel-bb.com/en/hotel/orly-chevilly-larue"
                >Our hotel</a
              >
              was about 20km to the south of Paris, chosen because it had free
              parking and was a rather miserable affair. Whilst everything was
              OK, the room was tiny, the beds were poor and the bathroom
              squashy. But it was cheap and close to public transport to get us
              into town.
            </p>
            <h2>Into town</h2>
            <p>
              So on Sunday morning we headed into town. First we had to get the
              tram line T7 from Moulin Vert and then switch to the metro line 7
              at Villejuif Luis Aragon. Or that was the idea. Unfortunately the
              metro line was blocked due to a broken down train, so what should
              have been a 40 minute journey into town took about an hour and a
              half.
            </p>
            <h2>Pantheon</h2>
            <p>
              We started our journey at the Jussieu metro station and headed
              towards the pantheon.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="/assets/images/2022/paris-day1-1.jpg"
                alt="Frontal view of the Pantheon with its six big pillars."

                height="600"
              />
            </p>
            <h2>Notre Dame</h2>
            <p>
              After the pantheon and a first glimpse of the Eiffel Tower, we
              headed towards the Notre Dame cathedral. This lead us past a flea
              market selling all sorts of worthless overpriced junk.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="/assets/images/2022/paris-day1-2.jpg"
                alt="Flea market with tables full of bric-a-brac."

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              The Notre Dame was still being repaired following the fire in the
              spring of 2019. So we couldn't go in, or even get too very close
              to it. It still remains an impressive cathedral sitting in the
              middle of the Seine.
            </p>

              />
            </p>
            <h2>Louvre</h2>
            <p>
              Next we headed to the Louvre, the world's biggest museum. We
              skipped going in, deciding that deserved a holiday in itself. Mona
              Lisa will have to wait.
            </p>
            <p>

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              We continued on through the park, past the place de la Concorde
              and onto the Champs-Elysees.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="/assets/images/2022/paris-day1-5.jpg"

              />
            </p>
            <h2>Arc de Triomphe</h2>
            <p>
              We walked up the Champs-Elysees, a much more ordinary road than I
              was expecting, and on to the Arc de Triomphe. The Champs-Elysees
              was shut to cars that day, due to an open air cinema being
              prepared at the eastern end, just in front of the Arc de Triomphe.
              This made it a nice leisurely stroll.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="/assets/images/2022/paris-day1-6.jpg"
                alt="View of the impressive Arc de Triomphe from across the round about."
                loading="lazy"
                decoding="async"
                width="800"
                height="600"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              We got to the roundabout in the centre of which is the Arc de
              Triomphe. It is certainly an impressive monument. We used the
              underpass under the roundabout to get to it and strolled around
              the bottom of it for a while.
            </p>
            <h2>Eiffel Tower</h2>
            <p>
              Next we headed to the Eiffel Tower. This led us past a statue of
              George Washington. So much for freedom fries.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="/assets/images/2022/paris-day1-7.jpg"

                width="600"
                height="800"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally we reached the Eiffel Tower, just as the sun decided to
              make an appearance on what had up until then been a rather grey
              affair.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="/assets/images/2022/paris-day1-8.jpg"
                alt="The Eiffel Tower from across the Seine with trees in the foreground"

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              The Eiffel Tower really is impressive in its size compared to the
              rest of Paris. It sticks out like sore thumb, but a magnificent
              one! As you get close, the size becomes ever more apparent, until
              you are staring one of it's arched feet and feeling truly
              insignificant.
            </p>

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              We finished the day's sightseeing with a coffee at a caf√© in the
              gardens of &quot;yet another museum&quot; in Paris. In front of us
              was an elderly couple sharing a cocktail, with the man not letting
              go of the glass desperate for a drink and the woman making sure he
              does not drink it all himself! üôÇ
            </p>
            <p>

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              And so concluded our first day in Paris. We headed back to our
              hotel with yet more disruptions on the metro, arriving there
              around 10pm. Next time we will go by train to Paris and book a
              hotel in the centre, but this time we needed the car to carry on
              our journey after visiting Paris.
