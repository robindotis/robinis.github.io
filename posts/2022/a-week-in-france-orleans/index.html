              Our final full day in France was in Orleans, where we visited a
              friend. In fact it was the piano teacher of our daughters'. He's
              been living in Orleans for almost 30 years, having come as
              graduate student and worked his way up to professor of music, with
              all the benefits that brings - since it means being a state
              official. The idea was to watch a concert of his, unfortunately
              that did not happen.
            </p>
            <h2>Joan of Arc</h2>
            <p>
              The city of Orleans is all about Joan of Arc. There are statues to
              her everywhere. It also makes the place a very proud and
              independent city. We started our visit in the evening and had a
              stroll around the centre with an average dinner in a Thai fast
              food place. We did get a glimpse of the cathedral down the main
              boulevard.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
              The next day was a guided tour of the city with our friend. It
              started off with the main statue of Joan of Arc on the main
              square. Before heading to Groslot gardens and past Hotel Groslot.

              />
            </p>
            <h2>Cathedral</h2>
            <p>
              We then headed into the Cathedral, which has Joan of Arc's story
              pictured in it's stained glass windows. You could also see all the
              local family crests hanging on the sides of the main area within
              the cathedral. Proud of their local heritage they certainly are.
            </p>

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              We strolled around the city some more, which has been well
              restored - apparently the centre was totally rundown and
              unliveable off the main streets thirty years ago. Now you can see
              lots of beautiful old houses with their wooden beams.
            </p>
            <p>
              As commented by our friend, in Germany when they restore old
              buildings they make them look new, in France when they restore
              them, they still look old. Having grown up in Germany, I can
              confirm this difference.

            </p>
            <h2>Musee des Beaux-Artes</h2>
            <p>
              In the afternoon we decided to visit the museum of fine arts, just
              next to the cathedral. Fine art and looking at portrait after
              portrait of unknown people by artists you have not heard of is not
              my thing, but it still took me a good two hours to walk round the
              whole place. If fine art is your thing, this is apparently one of
              the best such museums in France, after the Louvre of course. Here
              are the two pictures I liked most.

            </p>
            <h2>Return home</h2>
            <p>
              And so ends our week in France. The next morning we drove home. We
              thought we might stop in Reims and the Champagne region, but that
              will have to wait for another day - the weather was not playing
              nice.
            </p>
            <p>
              The drive home was great. Due to the tolls, the French motorways
              are apparently not so busy away from the main cities. I put the
              car in cruise control and basically didn't have to touch the
              brakes or the accelerator, except for toilet stops.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course this comes at a price - just over 50 Euros once we
              exited the toll system near Metz, and hit the more overloaded, but
              free, part of the motorway.
