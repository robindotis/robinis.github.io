            <h3>Madrid and Toledo</h3>
            <p>
              The first thing that struck me on arrival in Madrid was the
              relaxed nature of everything, especially for a capital city
              (compare London!). The second thing was the amount of people on
              the streets at midnight - it was a Tuesday! I knew I was going to
              like this place.
            </p>
            <p>
              Madrid is a strange place, very lively and plenty to do, but
              somehow there are few things that are outstandingly beautiful.
              Certainly the Palacio Real is impressive in its size and the Plaza
              Mayor (and surroundings) is great for cafes and relaxing, but the
              beauty of Madrid lies in its way of life - busy, but still
              relaxed. The small alleys and roads around Puerto del Sol are
              great for wandering around in the evenings and the area around
              Lavapies contains a curious mix of Africans, Arabs, Asians and
              Caribbeans.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="/assets/images/toledo.jpg"
                alt="Toledo"
                width="400"
                height="283"
              />A nice day trip from Madrid is Toledo, a beautiful medieval town
              full of tiny alleys and cafes as well as an interesting castle
              (Alcazar) and Cathedral. There are also some nice bridges leading
              to the old town centre.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="/assets/images/toledo_street.jpg"
                alt="Backstreets of Toledo"
                width="400"
                height="278"
              />Would I recommend visiting Madrid? Just about - mainly for the
              attraction around it, Madrid not being particularly touristy.
              Could I see myself living there? Absolutely. Madrid appears to be
              more easily appreciated as local than a tourist.
            </p>
            <h3>Segovia and Avila</h3>
            <p>
              <img
                src="/assets/images/segovia_castle.jpg"
                alt="Segovia Castle"
                width="276"
                height="400"
              />My plan was to head to Segovia for a day and then continue on to
              Avila, as they are just next to each other on the map. So on
              arrival I checked for buses from Segovia to Avila and found that
              the only bus that day was at 19.45! What sort of a time is that?
              Surely there ought to be one in the morning as well? So much for
              that idea. Anyway the things most worth seeing in Segovia (and you
              can hardly miss them) are the aquaduct and the fairy tale like
              castle. The aquaduct is noteworthy for two reasons. Firstly it is
              2000 years old and secondly it it was built without mortar - just
              brick upon brick. 2000 years old and still standing - they don't
              build things like that anymore. The castle on the otherhand is a
              largely rebuilt structure after a fire destroyed the original. A
              fair bit of artisitic licence was used in the rebuild and whilst
              it looks extremely pretty, it is not exactly authentic. It does
              however afford nice views of Segovia and its surroundings.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="/assets/images/aquaduct.jpg"
                alt="Segovia Aquaduct"
                width="400"
                height="280"
              />An interesting walk goes round the edge of the town (just follow
              the green route on the free tourist map) and winds through a nice
              park. It also gives interesting views of the castle. For fantastic
              views of Segovia take a stroll up the road to the bizzarly named
              village of Zamarramala(!). This is also a nice place to catch a
              glimpse of spanish village life.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="/assets/images/avila.jpg"
                alt="Avila"
                width="394"
                height="272"
              />The next day I headed back to Madrid in order to get to Avila,
              due to the rediculous bus times mentioned above. The striking
              thing about Avila are its completely intact city walls. Also the
              interior of the cathedral is interesting and slightly dazzling,
              due to the red limestone in the bricks.
            </p>
            <h3>Burgos</h3>
            <p>
              <img
                src="/assets/images/burgos.jpg"
                alt="Burgos"
                width="400"
                height="278"
              />After Avila, my plan was to head north to Bilbao, changing in
              Burgos, but again this went horribly wrong. I arrived in Burgos
              and went to buy a ticket to Bilbao on an express train, but the
              train was fully booked. This is something unknown in England
              (trains are never fully booked, they just cram you in even
              tighter). So I ended up staying two nights in Burgos.
            </p>
            <p>
              Initially Burgos struck me as rather dull, but this was probably
              due to the fact that it was Monday lunchtime and nobody was
              around. In fact there are a couple of nice monastries either side
              of the town. Both can be reached along interesting walks through
              parks along the river. There is also an interesting cathedral (as
              in all spanish towns) and there are nice views from the hilltop
              view point behind the cathedral. In the end I really enjoyed my
              stay here and it turned out to be a really lively city in the
              evenings. Next I headed back to Madrid for two days, checking out
              the Prado, before heading home.
            </p>
            <p>
              To me the Prado is a very boring museum. Row after row of portrait
              paintings - unless you have a degree in "History of Spanish Art"
              you won't see much sense in all of this (well I didn't anyway). I
              spent 90 minutes walking around the place and only found four
              interesting paintings. There were the "El dos de Mayo" and "El
              tres de Mayo" by Goya, a painting of a woman squirting her breast
              milk into a priests mouth and a painting which included a man with
              a flower up his arse by Bosch, a flemish artist (which explains it
              all!).
