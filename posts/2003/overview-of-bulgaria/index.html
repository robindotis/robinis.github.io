              Bulgaria is a beautiful, small country in the south-eastern corner
              of Europe. It has a population of some 8 million people and
              borders on Greece, Macedonia, Serbia, Romania and Turkey, as well
              as the Black Sea. Few people seem to know much about Bulgaria,
              which is surprising, given its rich history and interesting
              culture.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whilst most people probably know it is home to the famous yogurt
              culture "bacillus bulgaricus" (considered to be of great benefit
              to your health), few people would know it is home to the oldest
              gold ornaments in the world. Most people know the Russians use the
              Cyrillic alphabet, few know that this alphabet was created in
              Bulgaria - by the brothers Cyril and Methodius (who were
              themselves, in fact, Macedonian). Most people have probably heard
              of the Greek poet and musician Orpheus, but few know that he spent
              most of his time wandering the Rhodope mountains in Bulgaria -
              also known as the "Land of Orpheus". If you're British you may
              remember the incident involving a Bulgarian dissident and a poison
              tipped umbrella. But who knows, for example, that a Bulgarian folk
              song (Valya Balkanska) was chosen to accompany pieces by Mozart
              and Beethoven on the Voyager space probe, and is still now "going
              where no man has ever gone before"? Bulgaria is one of the best
              kept secrets on the planet. In fact Bulgaria appears to be so good
              at hiding information, that Bill Clinton should be taking notes!
            </p>
            <h3>A Brief History Of Bulgaria...</h3>
            <p>
              Bulgaria has been inhabited for many thousands of years. There
              appear to be archeological sites pretty much everywhere you go in
              Bulgaria. A testament to the fact that it has been inhabited by
              the Thracians, Greeks and Romans - all leaving a substantial
              footprint in the country. The first Bulgarian state was formed in
              681 by Khan Asparukh - making it pretty much the oldest state in
              Europe. Apart from an 180 year period of rule by the Byzantine
              empire, the state lasted until 1362, when Bulgaria was conquered
              by the Ottoman Turks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whilst the Turks ruled Bulgaria for over 500 years, Bulgarian
              culture and identity managed to survive in isolated monasteries.
              This is one of the reasons monasteries are given such cultural
              importance in Bulgaria. Towards the end of 18th century the
              Bulgarian identity started to reassert itself and Bulgarian art,
              music and literature started to flourish. Finally, in 1878, after
              some failed uprisings, the year- long Russian-Turkish War and
              numerous massacres and atrocities, Bulgaria gained independence
              from the Turks.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next 70 odd years through to the end of 2nd World War, were
              turbulent times for Bulgaria and the Balkan Peninsula. There was
              much fighting between the Serbs, Greeks, Bulgarians, Macedonians
              and Turks in the lead up to and during the 1st World War. In an
              attempt to gain control over Macedonia, Bulgaria sided with the
              Germans during this war, thus coming out on the losing side. At
              the start of the 2nd World War Bulgaria declared itself neutral,
              however with German troops massing on the Romanian-Bulgarian
              border, Bulgaria sided with the Germans to avoid a war it could
              not win. It thus declared war on France and Britain, but crucially
              not on Russia. Also, it refused to deport the 50,000 odd Jews
              living on Bulgarian territory. Thus, despite playing only a very
              minor part in the War, Bulgaria ended up on the losing side. The
              Russians finally invaded in 1944 and took control of the country,
              setting up a communist government in 1945.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the next 45 years Bulgaria was subject to a Communist
              government intolerant of any other political view points. However,
              the regime was not all bad, and thanks to Russian investment, the
              country was transformed from an agricultural back water to an
              industrialised nation by the mid 1970s. However when the Russian
              economy started to falter, so did Bulgaria, leading to the
              collapse of communism in 1989. However, Bulgaria avoided the
              violent turmoil of its communist neighbours and held peaceful
              elections in 1990. Since then the prosperity capitalism seemed to
              promise has eluded Bulgaria and the country is still now trying to
              recover from economic collapse and hyper-inflation in the late
              1990s.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bulgarians have become very distrustful of all politicians due to
              the high level of corruption in the country. This is in itself a
              legacy of the transition from communist to democratic state, for
              whilst it was peaceful, it did not remove the old communist regime
              from power and former communist leaders are still running most
              Bulgarian political parties. It is important to note however, that
              the political corruption in Bulgaria does not affect tourists and
              Bulgaria is certainly the safest country to visit in the area, if
              not the majority of Eastern Europe. On the positive side, a
              currency board has pegged the lev to the German Mark (and then the
              Euro) since 1999 and this has lead to macro-economic stability and
              growth in the last 4 years.
