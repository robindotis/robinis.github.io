              In June 2011 the Netherlands became the first European country and
              only the second one world-wide (after Chile) to
              <a
                href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/jun/23/netherlands-enshrines-net-neutrality-law"
                >enshrine net neutrality into Dutch law</a
              >. It essentially outlaws the blocking of Internet services (eg
              Skype) on mobile devices as was being done by several mobile
              operators in Holland.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am no expert on the subject, but it seems to me that ISPs
              (especially mobile ones) are increasingly trying to get around
              network neutrality and that the real reason is not technical in
              nature or to be fairer to consumers. Far from it - rather the
              complete opposite. They have no idea how to price their services
              without scaring off consumers. An argument put forward by the ISPs
              against network neutrality is that it is unfair on most consumers,
              because the big movie downloaders and frequent Skype users are
              blocking the network for the rest. They therefore want to throttle
              heavy users based on the application they are using rather than
              the amount of data being downloaded. To any outside observer this
              is clearly illogical, first and foremost because you end up
              hitting all users not just those downloading the most.
            </p>
            <h3>If you play, you pay.</h3>
            <p>
              If the bandwidth used by some consumers is too high then charge
              <em>them</em> more and don't come up with convoluted schemes to
              make everyone's Internet experience worse.
            </p>
            <p>
              We're all used to paying for electricity by the
              <abbr title="kilowatt hour">kWh</abbr> and for petrol by the litre
              (or gallon). Why should this be any different for Internet
              downloads? Sure, we've become used to bundled minutes with our
              land line and mobile contracts. Voice calls, however, have become
              so cheap thanks to technology and competition that there's no
              money in them. Better therefore, for the ISPs, to bundle more
              minutes than anyone will ever use into an expensive package. This
              is also better for many consumers as they have a fixed price and
              don't need to worry about expensive bills at the end of the month.
              Unfortunately we are still a few years away from Internet
              bandwidth becoming that cheap.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the meantime, ISPs are trying to hide from the majority of
              their clients that they are actually subsidising the internet
              habits of the power user. By charging everyone the same ¬£20/month,
              no matter how much they use the Internet, ISPs actually make a
              huge profit on the casual user and take a small hit on the power
              users. At least they used to. With the advent the YouTube, Skype
              conferencing, music services such as Spotify and especially BBC
              iPlayer the number of power users has increased significantly and
              the cross-subsidy is no longer profitable. So rather than impose
              download limits on the basic package and charge an appropriate fee
              for the power user package, they simply want to charge you for
              using Skype. This is especially handy for them as there are other
              compelling motives for ISPs to do this. For example the use of
              Skype on mobile devices can get around the prohibitively expensive
              rates mobile providers are currently charging for things such as
              international calls or roaming. Or the ISPs want to get you to
              download movies from their own overpriced and under-stocked online
              movie store.
            </p>
            <h3>Net neutrality needs to be protected</h3>
            <p>
              Thus, in order to ensure fair play and competition on the Internet
              as well as the quality of Internet services, net neutrality needs
              to be enshrined in law across the –ïU. I am grateful to Holland for
              taking the first step in this direction. I hope the EU follows
              suit shortly.
