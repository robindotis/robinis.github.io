    <p>Everyone knows that exercise is good for you. Not just on a physical level, but it also makes you "happier" due to the release of Endorphins, the body‚Äôs natural feel good chemicals.&nbsp; Well, since I completed the <a title="Completed Couch To 5K" href="/posts/2011/completed-couch-to-5k/">C25K</a> program I've started noticing there's much more to it than simply being happier. Jogging seems to have some sort of meditative effect, a fact I alluded to in my post on the <a title="Anatomy of one of my&nbsp;jogs" href="/posts/2011/anatomy-of-one-of-my-jogs/">anatomy of one of my jogs</a>. I noted that once I really get going I am able to spend a few seconds at a time in a trance like state with a completely clear mind. On top of that, towards the end of the jog all the aches and pains actually dissapear. Well here's my theory as to why that is.</p>
<p>On my last run I was struggling somewhat and was getting frustrated by this. (It turns out I was actually coming down with a bit of a flu, but that's by the by). Well before the 4km mark I was having conversations with my inner demons as to when I would "give up". I was aiming for 7k in 40 minutes for that run and it was obvious I was not going to manage <em>that</em>.&nbsp; These conversations go something like this:</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Must keep going, must keep going<br><strong>My inner demon:</strong> It is so much easier and less painful just to stop<br><strong>Me:</strong> No! I will not stop.<br><strong>My inner demon:</strong> Well, have some of this then.</p>
<p>At this point imagine a little red demon jabbing me under my right knee cap with his little pitch fork.</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Ouch! No, must keep going!<br><strong>My inner demon:</strong> Stop torturing yourself and stop running, this might help.</p>
<p>He jabs me under my left knee cap.</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Arghhh. You little #$!%@%#! Maybe just a <em>little</em> bit further then...</p>
<p>And so it goes on until he's basically defeated me and I have actually decided to stop "at the next corner". Note: <em>I really have decided to stop, I am not just trying to trick him.</em> And so I jog on. My inner demon, in the meantime accepts this and obviously decides to take a well earned break and head out for a nice cup of tea and a biscuit, or whatever it is that inner demons do in their time off. And guess what? With the little git with the pitch fork out for a walk all my pain dissapears.&nbsp; So I get to the next corner and... carry on.</p>
<p>This happens Every. Single. Run. Now I am prepared!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong></p>
<p>Isn't it strange how when you've been turning an idea over and over in your head for a while you often come upon an article that affirms your thoughts, almost exactly. Well this is precisely what happened to me over the weekend, when I came across the BBC article "<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/athletics/15499892.stm">Running as Therapy</a>".</p>
<p>It's nice to know I am not crazy!</p>
