            <p>
              <img
                alt="Kiwi Experience"
                src="/assets/images/kiwiexp.jpg"

                height="233"
              />I had to hang around till 5.30 am at Nadi Airport for my flight
              out. Fiji might be the most gorgeous place on earth, but its
              airport sucks. I would strongly advise against trying to stay the
              night here, the chairs are awful and designed in such a way that
              it is impossible lie down across a row of them. The flight was Ok
              and I arrived in Auckland, New Zealand a few hours later. I
              checked into the Auckland Central Backpackers (ACB). This must be
              the biggest hostel in the world. The thing had about 10 floors,
              including a roof top cafe. I didn't get up to much in Auckland. It
              seemed like a nice place, but I was still in Fiji mode and
              couldn't get used to the 'busy' way of life. So I decided for the
              easy option for touring New Zealand and bought myself a Kiwi
              Experience ticket. Whilst it seemed a tad expensive, I had a great
              laugh for the month I used the ticket and would recommend this to
              anyone else wanting to see New Zealand in a relatively short space
              of time.
            </p>
            <h2>Kiwi Experience</h2>
            <p>
              <img
                alt="Waikato River"
                src="/assets/images/rivernz.jpg"
                width="400"
                height="263"
              />The first stop was Whittianga, then onto Rotorua, via Mt
              Maunganui. Rotorua is interesting for the steam holes. The whole
              town smells of sulphur! It also seems to be a centre of Maori
              culture. Next we drove to Taupo, stopping off to see Glow Worm
              caves and the Aranui caves. Taupo is a nice place and it is well
              worth going sailing on Lake Taupo with Bill Dawson and his boat
              "Barbary". Also the Huka falls are interesting, not so much for
              their size, but for the impressive colour of blue which is formed
              in the falls. Then it was on to Wellington, stopping off for a
              night at a place called River Valley Lodge. Here we went to a
              local Christmas party. This was fun, if only because I had never
              before seen Santa Clause arrive in a rubber dinghy wearing
              sunglasses!
            </p>
            <p>
              In Wellington I stayed in a place called "Rowena's". A nice place
              place slightly up the hillside. I found Wellington to be the
              nicest town in New Zealand. It seemed to have some flair and
              culture (sadly, a rare thing round this part of the world). But be
              warned, Wellington is not called 'Windy Wellington' for nothing.
              The north island was interesting and I had great time with the
              friends I met on the bus, but now it was time to head for the
              South Island and discover New Zealand's true natural beauty.
            </p>
            <h2>South Island</h2>
            <p>
              <img
                alt="Pancake Rocks"
                src="/assets/images/pancakerocks.jpg"
                width="384"
                height="256"
              />The boat ride across to the south island is nice and leads
              through the delightful Marlborough Sounds. From here I then got
              another Kiwi Experience bus to Nelson, where I stayed for 3 days.
              Nelson is Ok, it has a Cathedral, allowing the place to call
              itself a city despite a population of around 150,000. The official
              centre of New Zealand is also near here. It's a nice walk there,
              albeit up a rather steep hill. Well it would be in New Zealand,
              wouldn't it! Next we drove to Westport and from there on to the
              pancake rocks. A rather peculiar rock formation, as can be seen on
              the picture.
            </p>
            <p>
              From here we then drove to the Franz-Joseph-Glacier. The next day
              I opted for the full day glacier hike.
              <img
                alt="Franz-Josef Glacier"
                src="/assets/images/fjglacier.jpg"
                width="398"
                height="316"
              />This was an experience I shall never forget. I am not the
              greatest hiker in the world. In fact for me the definition of a
              hike is the 10 minute walk I have into work everyday. So walking
              on ice, with holes and ravens either side of you, is something
              quite different. My adrenaline was pumping I can assure you that.
              I think I was in the doomed group anyway, as everybody in our
              group had some kind of fall or scratch by the end of the day. But
              at least it made feel at home again, for it was Christmas Eve and
              white!
            </p>
            <p>
              Christmas Day we drove to Makaroa, via Lake Mathieson. There
              should have been a perfect reflection of the mountains in this
              lake, but it was cloudy. Damn. I have been told though that the
              view is exactly like all the postcards show it. I'll have to go
              back one day. The Christmas day party was great in the evening and
              the next morning it was off to Queenstown, the adrenaline capital
              of the world.
            </p>
            <h2>Queenstown</h2>
            <p>
              <img
                alt="Milford Sound"
                src="/assets/images/milfordsound.jpg"
                width="384"
                height="256"
              />Having partially recovered from our hangovers, the bus drove on
              to Queenstown, passing Lake Hawea and Lake Wanaka. Both very nice.
              We were due to stop in Wanaka, but decided to head straight for
              Queenstown since none of us were in a state for solving puzzles -
              which is what Wanaka is famous for. This was much to the dismay of
              a fellow backpacker I later met in Australia. She was waiting to
              be picked up in Wanaka that day and thus had to stay an extra
              night!
            </p>
            <p>
              Queenstown is renowned for being the adrenaline centre of New
              Zealand. If it's dangerous, you can do it here. So I opted for the
              one day Milford Sound tour and save my adrenaline for another day.
              Milford Sound is beautiful. Actually it's a Fjord, but that
              doesn't seem to bother anybody here. It is also the wettest spot
              in New Zealand and thus rained all day. Actually this probably
              improved the sights, since the most impressive thing about it are
              the waterfalls gushing out of almost every nook and cranny in the
              rocks.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                alt="Mount Cook"
                src="/assets/images/mtcook.jpg"
                width="384"
                height="256"
              />The only problem with Queenstown was that because it was almost
              New Years Eve and the place has good party reputation there were
              no beds free over the New Year. So I headed for Dunedin. A nice
              place it is and New Years was ok there. After New Year, it was
              time to head back to Queenstown and catch the Kiwi Experience bus
              on to Mt Cook for the night. Mt Cook is beautiful and for me the
              nicest sight in New Zealand (although there was also
              Franz-Joseph-Glacier, Milford Sound, Lake Wanaka, Marlborough
              Sounds and and and). Finally the bus took me to Christchurch.
              Except for rather eccentric 'official' Wizard of Christchurch,
              this is a pretty dull affair. My only real reason for stopping
              here was to catch my plane on to Australia. Well, what can I say
              about New Zealand, except that it must surely be the most
              beautifully diverse country on Earth.
