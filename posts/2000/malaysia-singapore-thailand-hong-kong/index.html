            <p>
              <img
                alt="Batu Caves"
                src="/assets/images/batucave.jpg"

              />Reverse Culture Shock - I believe is the correct term. I arrived
              in KL and got picked up by my friend at the airport, who drove me
              to my accommodation. Now, it just so happens that my mates family
              own a very successful chain of hotels (Grand Continental) across
              Malaysia. So when I walked into my new room, I didn't walk into
              some drab room with insects crawling around the floor, as had been
              the norm for the last 6 weeks. Instead I couldn't believe my eyes
              when my mate showed me into one of the hotel's suites. I didn't
              even dare sit down. Eventually my mate convinced to take a seat,
              so I cautiously sat down on the edge of the bed. Wow!
            </p>
            <p>
              KL is a nice city, quite developed, it's one of the major shopping
              destinations in Asia for rich tourists. In view of this, I am
              hardly surprised at the number of shopping centres in this city.
              Buildingwise, the Petronas Towers are certainly very impressive,
              but there are (or were then) a plethora of half finished high rise
              buildings, a legacy of the Asian tiger economy gone bust.
              Personally, I thought KL was OK, but it wasn't exceptional and was
              not that interesting.
            </p>
            <p>
              My mate kindly organised a couple of day trips to various
              historical towns. Melaka, on the west coast, south of KL, is very
              interesting, having been settled by the Portuguese, Dutch and
              English at various points in history. Also impressive are the Batu
              caves. These are vast caves with various Hindu shrines hewn into
              them. Plenty of monkeys around the place add to the peculiar
              atmosphere. Thanking Min for the wonderful time I had in KL, I got
              a train to Singapore, about 3 hours south.
            </p>
            <h3>Singapore</h3>
            <p>
              <img
                alt="Raffelesia"
                src="/assets/images/raffelesia.jpg"
                width="400"
                height="216"
              />Singapore is wonderful. The streets are clean, the buildings in
              perfect condition, the traffic calm and the whole city extremely
              organised. It makes a huge change to the other large Asian cities
              and they even have pedestrian crossings, a somewhat novel idea in
              most Asian cities. I stayed in a nice place called Season
              Homestay. The owner was friendly and helpful and there was a free
              breakfast.
            </p>
            <p>
              Highlights of Singapore must be Orchard Street for the shopping,
              Arab St. with some nice mosques and little India for its small
              alleys full of shops. But the best thing must be the underground!
              I have never seen any transport system this clean and efficient.
              It certainly beats the pants off the London underground. Of
              historic interest is the Raffelesia Hotel, supposedly the finest
              hotel in the world - not that I could afford to go in and find
              out.
            </p>
            <p>
              After spending the next two days yo-yoing between Malaysia and
              Singapore (hard to explain, but mainly due to all the places of
              interest to me being packed out due to a public holiday in
              Malaysia) and becoming good friends with the border guards, I
              decided to head to Thailand. It was also around about this time
              that I decided to start making my way home (which was Germany at
              the time). So I booked myself on a bus to Hat Yai, south Thailand,
              in the hope of catching a connecting bus on to Bangkok from there.
            </p>
            <h3>Thailand</h3>
            <p>
              I arrived in Hat Yai about 8 hours later after leaving Singapore
              and had to hang around there for 5 hours before my bus for Bangkok
              was due to leave. Being somewhat tired I sat myself down in a food
              hall and watched Back to Future in Thai.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bangkok has it all. Culture, history, nightlife and all three
              vices. It is, I imagine, the latter which attracts a lot of the
              tourists. Kao San Road is possibly the most famous street on the
              backpacking trail. The vibrant mix between western and Asian
              culture makes this a great place to hang out. Some might complain
              about the increasing commercialisation of the street and the
              difference some 18 months later (see elsewhere) was definitively
              noticeable. But those who complain are being unfair. If you don't
              like the place, go elsewhere.
            </p>
            <p>
              As far as attractions go, there's plenty to see. A great way of
              doing this, is to take the river boat services. They are cheaper,
              quicker and infinitely quieter than getting a tuk-tuk or taxi
              through the crowded Bangkok streets. Wat Pho is worth a visit,
              with its multitude of temples and stupas. It is also home to
              Thailand's largest reclining Buddha. On the other side of the
              river is Wat Arun, for me so most spectacular temple in Bangkok,
              especially at sunset. Another must see are the Royal Barges and,
              if you're interested, take a walk around the surrounding 'floating
              city' with houses on stilts above the river. It offers an
              interesting view into a more genuine Thai way of life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next I headed off to Hong Kong to visit a friend of mine from
              University.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am afraid there's no photos from here on, since my camera
              screwed up somewhere in Kuala Lumpur and the photos didn't turn
              out. I have since been back to Bangkok and I will add some photos
              once I've scanned them in. I have no idea when I'll be back in
              Hong Kong, so if anybody wants to 'donate' some photos, just get
              in touch. :-)
            </p>
            <h3>Hong Kong</h3>
            <p>
              Flying into Hong Kong is a hair raising experience. Being able to
              look into peoples homes is not something I would normally want to
              do from a plane. But this is how close the planes get to the high
              rise flats when landing in HK. Sadly (or thankfully, depending on
              how you look at it) this experience will be spared future
              passengers, due to the completion of the new airport, slightly
              further out.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hong Kong is a big bustling 24 hours city. It is also, probably,
              the most capitalist city in the world, despite being Chinese. This
              means that with the right money you can get anything and
              everything here. As far as tourist attractions go, Victoria Peak
              offers great views of Hong Kong harbour. If you want to get away
              from it all the nearby islands are relaxing or, if you don't like
              boats, get a bus to Stanley on Hong Kong island. This is a nice
              place with some touristy markets, good for getting souvenirs and
              presents. Finally Kowloon is a must for shopping and if you go
              there from Hong Kong island, get the Star ferry, the first ferry
              company in Hong Kong.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nightlife in Hong Kong is sorted too. I went to a Cream (the
              Liverpool nightclub) gig on my first night in Hong Kong, which was
              excellent. The other nights weren't bad either.... Also I had a go
              at the races but, as always with me, I lost. And that's it! I flew
              back to Bangkok, hung around the airport for half a day and then
              flew home.
            </p>
            <h3>Home sweet home</h3>
            <p>
              Arriving home was a strange feeling. The first thing which struck
              me was how calm, peaceful and quiet everything was, compared those
              mad Asian cities. Secondly it was great to see family and friends
              again. But within about 2 weeks all I could think was: "I wanna go
              again". I am writing this over two years since getting back and I
              still promise myself "I'll go next summer". But one day I will and
              I know that whatever it might be I have to give up to do so, it
              will be worth it.
