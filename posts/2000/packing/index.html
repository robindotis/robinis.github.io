            <h3>Packing Light</h3>
            <p>
              I am not going to go into great detail on the ins and out of
              travelling light. You'll probably have heard this a hundred times
              before, but it is important to travel light. There are two reasons
              for this. Firstly, you are going to be lugging everything you take
              around with you for the next few weeks or months. You are likely
              going to have to do at least a fair bit of walking, to reach
              hostel, hotels, bus stops and train stations, possibly in a hurry.
              So the less you take the easier it will be to reach these places.
              Secondly, the less you take, the smaller your bag pack will be.
              For me this is actually more important than the first point.
              Travelling light is relative. Some people can lug 30kg or more
              around with them no probs. For others (like me!) 15kg is already
              too much. I met one guy in Christchurch, NZ, travelling with what
              appeared to be a wardrobe on his back. But then this guy could
              have taken on Arnie if you get what I mean. Actually he worked on
              fishing boats in Alaska for 6 months in the year (spending the
              rest of his time travelling). So he was a tough fellow. But if he
              ever has to get on a crowded bus in Asia, good luck to him. In
              these situations having a bag at all is a right pain. This, of
              course, can't be avoided. So try and keep your backpack to a
              reasonable size. I travelled with a "70 litre Travel Trekker" from
              "Lowe Alpine". This was (I say was because it got stolen on a
              boat, see
              <a title="Preparation" href="/posts/2000/preparation/"
                >Preparation</a
              >
              page) a really good bag. Maybe already a tad too big, but well
              designed and thought out. For more info on travel gear see my
              links section.
            </p>
            <h3>Packing list</h3>
            <p>
              On the next page you'll find my packing list for my trip. I also
              indicate whether the item was of any use or not. We all make
              mistakes....<br />Total weight was about 18kg. Just about light
              enough.
              <strong>Oh, and don't forget your ticket and passport.</strong>

                    Hiking boots were a bit heavy a lot of the time, but were
                    very handy otherwise. I would take them again, depending on
                    the type of place I go to. Bought some sandals in Asia, and
                    threw away the shoes which were worn out. As for the flip
                    flops. They were handy, but mine were a little big. Make
                    sure they're light and small (depending on you're shoe size
                    of course....).

                    I had one for the beach and one small spungy one which can
                    soak up something like ten times it own weight. Both were
                    handy, but I exchanged the proper towel for a sarong once in
                    Asia. A much better solution. Sarongs are excellent. They
                    can be used as towels, bed covers, skirts (also for men!)
                    and many other things that I am sure I don't know
                    about....yet. Also they are extremely light and squashable.

                    Ok, I learnt the hard way here. I really only needed the
                    sleep sack. On occasions the sleeping bag was usefull, but a
                    couple of lairs of extra clothing would have done the job
                    too. I also took a "Therm-a-rest" inflatable mat. Whilst
                    these a really light and compact if you need them, mine was
                    a complete waste of space and weight, since I didn't use it
                    once. I think if I were to do the same trip again, I would
                    only take the sleep sack. I had a cotton one. If you can
                    afford it take a Silk one. They are really comfortable.

                    All of these were usefull. The torch would have been more
                    usefull if I had actually taken it with me on occasions that
                    I really needed it.... see elsewhere. D'Oh. Taking a Journal
                    is really handy for later, as you won't be able to remember
                    everything in a few years time. I am writing this over a
                    year after getting back and really enjoyed looking up things
                    in my journal. It's also always handy to have a book for
                    reading on rainy days or long bus trips. Although reading on
                    buses is a bit of an Oxymoron(!) in most cases. You will
                    find plenty of second hand book stores where you can buy
                    cheap ones or exchange them. Of course, it's cheaper if you
                    exchange with a fellow backpacker. The walkman was also
                    handy on long bus rides.
