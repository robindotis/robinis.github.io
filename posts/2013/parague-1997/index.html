                alt="Prague"

              I travelled to Prague by train from Munich (I was studying here at
              the time) to join my brother and friends on an easter holiday. We
              stayed in some student halls of residence, which were empty during
              the holidays and crammed about six of us into a room for four.
              Prague is certainly a very beautiful city and also very lively. At
              the time I went it was also extremely cheap (although had become
              quite expensive since my brothers first visit - this being his
              fourth). I would guess that nowadays central Prague, once
              attracting tourists seeking a cheap holiday, has turned into a
              typical european tourist city - with prices to match, although
              still reasonable. But venture slightly out of Prague and the
              prices quickly drop.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="/assets/images/charles_bridge.jpg"
                alt="Charles' Bridge"
                width="300"
                height="210"
              />Getting around Prague is easily enough with its underground,
              trams and buses forming a well-functioning public transport
              system. In terms of things to see , I would say the three "must
              see's" are Charles' Bridge (a great place to pick up a painting or
              protrait), the castle (Hradcany) and cathedral on the hill across
              the river from the main town centre and also the main town square
              (Staromestska namesti) around which are situated the old town
              hall, an astronomical clock and two nice churches. Within the
              square there is also a good market for picking up interesting
              souvenirs.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="/assets/images/prague_square.jpg"
                alt="Prague Square"
                width="300"
                height="207"
              />
              Having said that public transport in Prague is good, actually the
              city very easily discovered on foot (in my opinion this goes for
              all towns and cities). This is also a great way to see the old
              backstreets and alleys of Prague. A nice walk could start from the
              town square, lead over the river (the Vlatva) using Charles'
              bridge and end up by the castle and cathedral on the hill. From
              here you can also visit Kafka's house, which is in the vicinity.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="/assets/images/kafka.jpg"

                width="300"
                height="208"
              />The night life in Prague is also lively and fun. There are
              plenty of restaurants, cafes, bars and clubs to keep you thorougly
              occupied during your stay here.
            </p>
            <p>
              Due to some major logistical problems (like there was no cheap
              accomodation available in Prague on Easter Sunday) we had to leave
              the city and decided on driving south to Bratislava in Slovakia.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="/assets/images/charlies_pub.jpg"
                alt="Charlie's Pub"
                width="300"
                height="210"
              />The drive to Bratislava was fairly uneventful. The city itself
              was not particularly pretty or interesting (athough I am sure if
              you search hard enough you will find plenty of things). We drove
              round looking for a hotel and ended up staying in what must surely
              be the largest hotel in the city (about 20 storeys tall). We
              checked into our rooms on roughly the 10th floor and spotted our
              venue for the nights entertainment (a place called Charlies Pub).
            </p>
            <p>
              First tough, we thought we should do at least some sightseeing and
              drove up to the castle (whose name I have forgotten). Whilst the
              castle is ok, the view from the hill is probably the most
              depressing I have seen - row upon row of grey tower blocks as far
              as the eye can see. Welcome to concrete jungle and the beauty of
              communist architecture (although to be fair most of the western
              european buildings of the 60s aren't any better). We quickly left
              and replenished our souls in Charlies Pub.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="/assets/images/concrete_jungle.jpg"
                alt="Concrete Jungle"
                width="300"
                height="214"
              />The next day we headed back to Prague and encountered the best
              of ex-communist bureaucracy and corruption. As we crossed the
              border into the Czeck Republic and started speeding off,
              overtaking a few cars on the way, we were flagged down by a
              policeman. Apparently we were speeding at double the speed limit,
              overtaking in a non-overtaking zone and had not bought a permit
              for the motorway. We were duly fined the equivalent of about 100
              pounds. After a it of haggling by my brother, this was quickly
              reduced to 20, but we would only get receipts for 10 - ie the
              policeman would pocket the other 10. This was probably close to a
              months wages in those days for a Czeck copper!
