              </figure>
              Spending easter in Brussels I decided to go to Paris for a day, a
              city I had never seen before. So I bought myself a one day return
              ticket to Paris on the TGV, boarded it at 9.30 am in Brussels and
              was in Paris before 11am, arriving at the Gare du Nord. From here
              I, unknowingly, set out on what became a seven hour trek around
              Paris.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started by walking up the hill to the Montmartre, for a nice, if
              rather grey and wet view of Paris. This set the scene for the rest
              of the day - rain and clouds. From here I then walked south, past
              Gare St. Lazare and onto Blvd. Hausmann, which I then followed
              west to the Arc de Triomphe.
            </p>
            <p>
              <figure>
                <img
                  src="/assets/images/arc_de_triomphe.jpg"
                  alt="Arc De Triomphe"
                  width="300"
                  height="200"
                />
                <figcaption>Arc De Triomphe</figcaption>
              </figure>
              After risking my life tyring to cross to the centre of the
              roundabout on which the Arc de Triomphe is placed, I climbed to
              the top (this I had to pay for and is therefore optional!) for
              further interesting views of Paris, especially down the Champs
              Elysees onto the Place de la Concorde. Once I had descended and
              left the roundabout, via the well sign-posted underpass this
              time(!!), I headed onto the Eiffel Tower.
            </p>
            <p>
              <figure>
                <img
                  src="/assets/images/eiffel_tower.jpg"
                  alt="Eiffel Tower"
                  width="300"
                  height="200"
                />
                <figcaption>Eiffel Tower</figcaption>
              </figure>
              A fairly long stroll later I was standing underneath the Eiffel
              Tower, which was good, since it was chucking it down! The Eiffel
              Tower really is, if not a beautiful structure, certainly a
              grandiose one. To think that it was built over 100 years ago
              certainly makes you wonder, and at the time it was the tallest
              structure in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having taken shelter from the elements for a wihle I continued on,
              walking south-east through the pretty Parc du Champ de Mars and
              then heading on to Invalides and the Eglise du Dome, which
              contains Napoleon's tomb. After resisting urges to shout
              'Waterloo' and 'Trafalgar' at the top of my voice, I continued
              north, through the Esplanade des Invalides and crossed the Seine
              at the Pont de la Concorde, which unsurprisingly brought me to the
              Place de la Concorde. Given that it is such a famous square, Place
              de la Concorde was rather ugly and dull and not very impressive at
              all. I am sure there are historical reasons for its fame, but it
              is not because of its beauty!
            </p>
            <p>
              <figure>
                <img
                  src="/assets/images/louvre.jpg"
                  alt="Louvre"
                  width="300"
                  height="200"
                />
                <figcaption>Louvre</figcaption>
              </figure>
              Next I continued east, through the Jardin du Carrousel to the
              Louvre with its glass pyramid. This was much more impressive than
              the Place de la Concorde, although perhaps this due to the sun,
              wich decided to make a brief appareance just as I reached the
              pyramid.
            </p>
            <p>
              My next destination was Notre Dame, famous for being the
              centrepiece of Victor Hugo's 'Hunchback of Notre Dame'. Situated
              on the Ile de la Cite in the middle of the Seine, the location is
              certainly beautiful (even in the rain). The queue to enter
              appeared about a mile long, so I skipped this, walked past the
              Notre Dame and left the island via the 'Pont de Archevoche' in the
              south-eastern corner of the island.
            </p>
            <p>
              <figure>
                <img
                  src="/assets/images/notre_dame.jpg"
                  alt="Notre Dame"
                  width="199"
                  height="300"
                />
                <figcaption>Notre Dame</figcaption>
              </figure>
              This led me into the Latin Quarter and what seemed like a more
              studenty area of Paris. Which makes sense this is where the
              Sorbonne, Paris' famous university, is situated. Thus I headed
              onto the Sorbonne, via a glimpse of the Pantheon, but to be honest
              I can't really remember much of the Sorbonne, since my thoughts
              were more in tune with sitting in a nice cafe whith a cold beer!
            </p>
            <p>
              But I had to press on and so headed back up north to see the
              Centre Georges Pompidou. This is a bizzare structure appearing to
              have all its piping on the outside. Beautiful it isn't, but worth
              seeing it certainly is. I didn't have time to enter though, as I
              had a train to catch at 7pm from the Gare du Nord. Being really
              quite knackered at this point, I decided to get the metro and
              reached the station with half an hour to spare, giving me enough
              time to grab a baguette to eat before the return journey.
            </p>
            <p>
              <figure>
                <img

                  alt="Pompidou"

                />
                <figcaption>Pompidou</figcaption>
              </figure>
              So it is possible to see Paris in a day (I needed seven hours to
              see most of it) and for free. Admittedly it is not a very cultured
              tour of Paris and doesn't do this huge and historical city
              justice, but in todays consumer society, I guess that's OK. :-)
