            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Back in March
              <a href="https://www.flypgs.com/en">Pegasus airlines</a> opened a
              new route from Plovdiv to Istanbul, so we thought we would give it
              a go when we went to Plovdiv for the Easter holidays. I booked
              some tickets ‚Ç¨70 return per person which seemed a reasonable
              price. I also booked the
              <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/tr/sapphire.html"
                >Sapphire Hotel</a
              >
              for three nights in the Fatih area of Istanbul, right next door to
              the Topkapi Palace, Ayasofya Mosque and the Sultanahmet Mosque.
            </p>
            <h2>Arrival</h2>
            <p>
              Our flight landed on time in Sabiha G√∂kcen airport and we
              proceeded to the exit of gate 13 where the hotel said we will find
              our pre-booked transfer. What a welcome to Turkey that was! We
              found the right location, but there were many others looking for a
              transfer at the same location and we were approached by several
              drivers offering a transfer, none of whom seemed to know our name
              or our destination. Not having roaming, I was unable to contact
              the hotel. After some standing around, looking like useless
              tourists (which we were), we eventually managed to get a transfer
              for ‚Ç¨45, which was ‚Ç¨5 less than the hotel had stated us. And so
              began our adrenalin fueled taxi ride from another dimension...
            </p>
            <p>
              We got in the cab and set off, a short while later the cab driver
              pulled into a nearby petrol station to refuel. Not for petrol as
              you might expect, but for RedBull and cigarettes. And so the fun
              began. More thrilling than a
              <a href="https://www.vdl.lu/fr/node/11240">Schueberfouer</a> ride,
              more dangerous than a shuttle launch and more scary than a Stephen
              King movie: our taxi driver was weaving in and out of traffic on
              the motorway into town, whilst holding a can of RedBull in one
              hand, a cigarette in the other, speaking to god knows who on one
              phone and using Google translate to give me the tourist highlights
              on another all whilst changing gears with the wrong hand. After
              too many &quot;beyond close&quot; calls with other cars on the
              road, including several where I thought &quot;that was a nice
              life, unfortunatrly didn't quite make it to 50&quot;, we promptly
              hit peak traffic around our hotel and didn't move for a good 20
              minutes whilst we were a 15 minutes walk from our hotel! After
              several more twists and turns to get passed multiple cars on
              streets too narrow for even one car, the driver stopped, pulled in
              between two traffic cones and said: &quot;this as close as I can
              get you, your hotel is down that road first on your left&quot;. So
              we got out, I gave a ‚Ç¨5 tip and we got to our hotel a few minutes
              later.
            </p>
            <h2>Day 1 - Easter Sunday</h2>
            <p>
              We started off on this cold, but sunny day, by walking around
              G√ºlhane park which is next to Topkapi palace.
            </p>
            <p>

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              Tulips had been planted in the park for Istanbul's Tulip festival
              which is in the whole month of April.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img

                width="600"
                height="800"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              At the northern end of the park we had a look at the Bosphorus.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="/assets/images/2023/bosphorus.webp"

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              We then headed back to the entrance of the Topkapi palace.
              Unfortunately the queues were so long we headed on to the Ayasofya
              Mosque only to be confronted by even longer queues.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="/assets/images/2023/ayasofya.webp"

                height="600"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              Not to be dispirited, we continued on to the Sultanahmet Mosque
              only to see that it was temporarily closed for restoration.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="/assets/images/2023/sultanahmet.webp"
                alt="Sultanahment Mosque"
                loading="lazy"
                decoding="async"
                width="600"
                height="800"
              />
            </p>
            <p>
              That would explain why the other two queues were so long. That and
              the fact the place was full of Easter weekend tourists.
            </p>
            <p>
              We headed onto the Mosaic Museum, via a nice market, but that was
              also shut.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              By now it was time for lunch, which we had on a roof top terrace
              that afforded great views of both the Bosphorus and the
              Sultanahmet Mosque. The food was also very nice.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img
                src="/assets/images/2023/sultanahmet-rooftop.webp"

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              Having relaxed a bit on the terrace we headed to the spice market
              on the other side of the Fatih quarter. Whilst interesting, spice
              wasn't the only thing they sold here, which made it feel like just
              another market.
            </p>
            <p>
              <img

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              Having failed to get into any of the mosques in the Topkapi palace
              area, we were happy to have a look inside the Yeni Mosque, just
              next to the spice market.
            </p>
            <p>

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              From here we could also see the Galata tower and were discussing
              on the merits of getting the tram across the bridge or walking
              when a guy managed to convince us to get on a one hour cruise
              around the Bosphorus. He gave us about 50% off the regular price,
              which we later realised was because it was probably the last
              cruise of the day and the boat was quite empty. Still, this meant
              we got good views as we sailed up and down a section of the
              Bosphorus.
            </p>

            <h2>Day 2 - Easter Monday</h2>
            <p>
              Our second day in Istanbul was essentially a day of cold and rain.
              The good thing about this was that it forced us to figure out the
              public transport and the benefits of the
              <a href="https://istanbulepass.com/how-to-get-istanbul-kart.html"
                >Istanbul Card</a
              >. The card costs 50TL and using it you get roughly half price
              fares compared to the regular fare. The best part being that you
              can share the card between five people, so no need to spend 200TL
              for the family just on cards. By sharing the card between the four
              of us, we recuperated the cost of the card after a couple of
              journeys.
            </p>
            <p>
              So we headed to Taksim square first on the tram and then up the
              hill with the funicular (which is a regular part of the public
              transport system and not a tourist thing). As it hadn't stopped
              raining, we stopped off in a nearby cafe for an hour or so and had
              a nice Turkish coffee.
            </p>
            <p>

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              Once it had more or less stopped raining we carried on walking
              through Taskim park, passed the technical university and down the
              hill along the Beshiktas football stadium and back to where we got
              off the tram. Since we hadn't yet been to the asian part (except
              for our mad taxi drive at the beginning) we got the ferry to the
              other side of the Bosphorus.
            </p>
            <p>

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              On the asian side we walked north-east along the riverside in the
              √úsk√ºdar district. Then we walked up the hill through a little park
              and back down to the ferry station along the main road. This gave
              us a better feel for what might be the more normal Istanbul away
              from the maddening tourist crowds.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
              We returned back to the Fatih district on the Marmaray train. This
              was an efficient, if dull, experience. It got us back to Fatih in
              about 3 minutes! Having spent the day getting around on various
              forms of public transport (tram, funicular, boat and train) I have
              to say that I am impressed with the public transport in this city.
              Still the roads are blocked full of cars! Maybe the day to day
              experience of public transport is different to the tourist one.
            </p>
            <p>
              We ended the day with a lovely meal in the
              <a href="https://www.instagram.com/saluteistanbul/"
                >Salute Restaurant</a
              >, 100 metres from our hotel. Definitely recommended.

            <h2>Day 3 - Return home</h2>
            <p>
              Our flight home was in the late afternoon and checkout was at
              midday, so we walked around the Topkapi area in the hope of there
              being no queues after the easter weekend. We were mistaken, but
              did manage to get into the Sultan Ahmed Tomb which was nice.
            </p>

              />
            </p>
            <p>
              Then we headed back to the hotel, grabbed our bags and got in the
              pre-booked taxi back to the airport. This time it was a normal
              drive along the motorway. No thrills, no danger, no scares.
