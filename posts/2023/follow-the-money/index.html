              This is an easy to follow whirlwind tour of where the UK
              government gets its money from and how it spends it. Full of facts
              and figures as well as some insightful commentary and significant
              critiscism of past taxation decisions across all parties. The
              biggest one being the lack of consistency, closely followed by
              lack of foresight and unwillngness to challenge current vested
              interests to improve the future of the country overall. Note that
              the latter is less about big business and lobbying and more about
              not wanting to upset the electorate.
            </p>
            <p>
              Definitely worth a read as it won't take you long. It took me a
              week. But what is missing is any real solution to these problems.
              Politicians have to win elections every few years so taking
              decisions which make some people poorer in the short term, but
              others better off in the long term is hard if you want to be
              re-elected. This conunmdrum is not solved by the book, which
              finishes with lots of good tips none of which will necessarily
              lead to an election victory in the current political climate. It
              finishes with the simple comment &quot;must do better if we are to
              cope with the next crisis&quot;. (Which, according to the book is
              going to be the climate crisis hitting at the same time as a
              really ageing population comes along.)
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, there was one point which I didn't quite agree with. In
              the discussion on student loans the book compared the current loan
              system to the new one being brought in from September 2023. In the
              current system, the student loan increases at RPI + 3%, the
              threshold above which you have to repay at 9% is ¬£27,500 and the
              loan is written off after 30 years. The estimate was that about
              25% would repay their loan in full. In the new system the loan
              increases with RPI only, the threshold is ¬£25,000 (and increases
              with RPI from 2025) and your loan is written off after 40 years.
              Paul's comparison of these two systems made the point that the old
              system was actually fairer because it penalises higher earners
              more. With the loan increasing above RPI higher earners are going
              to be repaying more overall in monetary terms than in the new
              system.This is because they will be repaying for longer as the
              amount owed increases quicker. Whereas for lower earners it
              doesn't matter because the amount owed is cleared after 30 years
              no matter how much was repaid. In the new system the amount owed
              does not increase so quickly, so higher earners will pay off their
              loan quicker and therefore pay less overall whereas lower earners
              will pay more because it is now 40 years before the loan is wiped.
            </p>
            <p>
              This analysis is obviously correct, but there is one point not
              mentioned at this point in the book. And that is the relative
              parental wealth of higher vs lower earners. I found this strange
              because otherwise the book is generally covering wealth aspects
              well, often making the point that tax should be equitable and the
              wealthy should be taxed more, when this makes economic sense. I
              feel the analysis of the current system is wrong, because higher
              earners mostly come from wealthier backgrounds so it is more
              likely that their university fees will simply have been covered by
              their parents, putting them completely outside of the loan system.
