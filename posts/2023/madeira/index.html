              We spent a week on Madeira in the last week in August before the
              school holidays finished.
            </p>
            <h2>The house</h2>
            <p>
              We booked what looked like a large house with pool and sea view
              somewhat above our usual price range and I wasn't sure what to
              expect. Well, we had the rare experience of the accomodation being
              exactly as advertised! A lovely sea view over the Arco da Calheta.
              The pool was large enough to almost swim lengths and play
              improvised water polo. The accomodation included a jacuzzi and a
              sauna, neither of which ended up using since the pool was enough.
              Perfect.

            <h2>The car</h2>
            <p>
              When picking up the car at the airport, a 1.2 litre Citroen, the
              lady at the desk was trying to get me to upgrade to a more
              powerful car for 200 Euro. She justified this given that Madeira
              had plenty of steep hills and given that there would be four of us
              in the car 1.2 litres might not be enough. I figured this was just
              a scam and chose not to. Well, I hadn't expected the roads to be
              quite so steep, especially off the main ones. Lack of power meant
              going uphill was largely done in first gear, unable to change up
              into second. Should we come again, I will try a more powerful car.
            </p>

            </p>
            <h2>The roads</h2>
            <p>
              A word on the road network on Madeira. I was really positively
              surprised by how well maintained and thought through the road
              network was. As mentioned above the roads were very steep at
              times, but the system of main roads was very easy to understand
              and to use. Essentially there are two levels of roads. Older ones,
              at the sea level, sometimes in need of a little maintenance.
              Whislst usually connecting the village, the idea of these roads
              was not to travel from village to village, but to access the local
              area (assesso local as the road signed indicated). About 50 metres
              above these local access roads, was the main road network,
              connecting the whole island. So to get from one village to another
              one further along, it would be more efficient to drive up to this
              level, get on the main roads and drive through the network of
              tunnels to your destination. The number of tunnels was astounding.
              Essentially these main roads are a set of tunnels which you only
              leave in order to get to the next village. So between two tunnels
              there would be a roundabout in order to get out of the tunnel
              network. Very simple and straightforward once you got the hang of
              it.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition I was also happy to see the driving was generally
              calm, unrushed and safe. Around Funchal you sometimes encountered
              someone in rush, probably because here there were two lanes in
              each direction. Once you were out of the city though, the roads
              were one lane each way, and being in a rush was simply of no use.
              Everyone drove at a reasonable speed, keeping a safe distance.
            </p>
            <h2>The climate and nature</h2>
            <p>
              We had a week of perfect weather. Not too hot, a little cloudy at
              times, pleasant in the evenings. Perfect. Up in the hills it was
              often cloudy, but down by the sea it was sunny. Madeira is full of
              Banana plantations on the hillsides around the coast. Higher up it
              takes on a distinct tropical feel. The terraced fields made it
              look like my memories of Bali. And some of the flora and fauna
              gave it a distinct Hawaii look and feel. Fantastic.

            <h2>Day 1: Funchal</h2>
            <p>
              On the first full day we headed off to Funchal, had a walk around
              the sea front area and then got on the cable car up the hill to
              the Monte Park area. Here we walked around a little and visited
              the &quot;Nossa Senhora do Monte&quot; church.
            </p>
            <p>
              We then walked all the steep 4km back down to the sea front. Our
              muscles thanked us the next day. An interesting aspect of this was
              walking alongside the levadas as we went. The levadas are a
              network of canals brining water from all over the island to where
              it is needed. Usually you follow these on the walks in the centre
              of the island. I wasn't expecting to walk next to them in Funchal.
              They do flow at quite a speed in the steep parts.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the walk down, we sat in a poncha bar for a well deserved
              drink, before heading home.

            <h2>Day 2: Madalena do mar</h2>
            <p>
              After the steep walk down the hill from Monte in Funchal, we
              needed a bit of a rest on the next day. So we spent the morning
              enjoying the house, pool and view, before heading off for lunch in
              the Madalena do Mar village. We had noticed the previous day,
              which was a Sunday, that this village had been closed off by the
              police due to festival taking place there. It seemed like the
              whole of Madeira was going as the roads for chock a block full in
              the other direction, including many many special service buses
              taking people to the area.

            <p>
              The village has a nice sea front with a peble beach. We sat down
              in the
              <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/7Km7gGcxE6P8jZB87"
                >Restaurante Cantinho da Madalena</a

              restaurant for a lovely sea food meal. After that we headed to the

            <h2>Day 3: Fanal and Porto Moniz</h2>
            <p>
              Afer taking it easy the previous day, we got up a little earlier
              and headed up the hill to the Fanal forest. The drive up was
              steep. Very steep. If there hadn't been cars similar to mine
              driving up in front of me, I might well have just turned round and
              gone to the beach. So after 20km or so of being stuck in first
              gear, we reached the Fanal forest area, which was completely
              covered in clouds. So the walk to Fio that we wanted to do with
              breathtaking views of the other side of Madeira wasn't really
              worthwhile, as we couldn't see more than 50 metres or so ahead.
              Instead we walked around the Fanal forest area, headed to the
              Fanal lake and walked back through fields taking care not to annoy
              the cows!

              After completing the walk around Fanal forest, we headed down the
              hill to the north side of the island to Porto Moniz. Here we
              enjoyed the views, then had a nice lunch before walking round the
              natural pools (we didn't bring our bathing suits...).

              Finally we headed back to our house to enjoy another nice evening
              watching the sunset. The kids also discovered that the previous
              occupants of the house had left their Netflix account on the TV,
              so that sorted us out for the evening, once it was dark!

            <h2>Day 4: Risco waterfall</h2>
            <p>
              A bit more relaxed, we had a later start and headed to the
              waterfall area to see the Risco waterfall, which is on the same
              path as the 25 waterfalls which are further along. We hiked down a
              steep road for about 40 minutes before reaching the cafe for a
              brief rest stop. After that we carried on and followed the path to
              the Risco waterfall, which was very impressive.

              On the way back as we were discussing the merits of hiking back up
              the steep road or getting the bus, two buses turned up and made
              the decision for us. This shortened the day somewhat, but meant we
              had more time to relax back at the pool.

              In the evening we then headed to the Calheta marina area for a

              The previous evening we had stayed up trying to watch the blue
              supermoon, which apparently appear irregularly once every 10 years
              or so, the next one being in 2037. It had still not appeared from
              behind the cliff by the time I went to bed. However it was still
              hangning around when I woke up around 7.30am.

              On our last but one day we decided to do the &quot;Sao
              Lorenco&quot; hike. After a late start to the day, we headed off
              around 11am and arrived at midday. That was a mistake. Apparently
              we were not the only ones doing this hike, as we had to park about
              a 20 minute walk from the trail head.
            </p>
            <p>
              The hike itself was great. Steep at times and quite busy on the
              narrower parts with no shade, at all. This meant we were
              sweltering in the sun all afternoon, except for at the cafe at the
              end of the trail. It was a lovely walk from which we arrived back
              home exhausted and hungry. So we headed for the &quot;Manifattura
              Di Gelato&quot; Italian restaurant at the marina we ate at the
              previous meaning. The food was great.

            <h2>Day 6:</h2>
            <p>
              Our final day was calm affair. We woke up late and hung out at the
              pool for a while, cleaned the house a little in preparation for
              our depature the next morning at 4.30am. We then headed back to
              the restaurant in Madalena do mar which we enjoyed so much on the
              second day. After another great lunch, we went to Funchal for a
              little souvenir shopping.
