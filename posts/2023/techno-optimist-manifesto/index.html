            <h2>by Marc Andreessen</h2>
            <p>
              These are my thoughts on the
              <a href="https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/"
                >The Techno-Optimist Manifesto</a
              >
              which made the web's techno news headlines recently.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's an ideology quite the opposite of the
              <a href="/posts/2023/communist-manifesto/">Communist Manifesto</a
              >, which I also read recently.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both promise us a much better life. They just get there by going
              in opposing directions. Neither of them seem to have much basis in
              actual reality in my opinion.
            </p>
            <h2>Lies</h2>
            <p>
              This whole intro is a lie. We are not being told any of these
              things. We are told to be weary of thechnology, to treat it with
              respect. With great power comes great responsibility.
            </p>
            <h2>Truth</h2>
            <p>
              Indeed, except I didn't realise the technology flag had been
              lowered.
            </p>
            <h2>Technology</h2>
            <p>
              Hmm... I agree with a lot of this. But he misses some major
              points.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                We have a problem of poverty, so we invent technology to create
                abundance.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Abundance for some, but at the moment this abundance is being
              wasted by the few rather than put to good use for the many.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                We believe this is why our descendents will live in the stars.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              The question is, can we live in the stars before we use up all the
              resources on the planet. We haven't yet turned the corner on
              wasting resources.
            </p>
            <h2>Markets</h2>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Markets prevent monopolies and cartels.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              No they don't. Plenty of monopolies in the world, also in the free
              capitalist world.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                We believe markets are an inherently individualistic way to
                achieve superior collective outcomes.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              You can believe that. Some people believe the earth is flat. It
              doesn't make it true. Where's the evidence for such a statement.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                We believe the ultimate moral defense of markets is that they
                divert people who otherwise would raise armies and start
                religions into peacefully productive pursuits.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Only if the spoils of the markets are fairly distributed. Not the
              case at the moment.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                We believe markets are the way to generate societal wealth for
                everything else we want to pay for, including basic research,
                social welfare programs, and national defense.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Why would we need social welfare programs if the markets actually
              worked?
            </p>
            <p>
              Why would we need national defense, if we were living in the
              stars?
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                We believe a Universal Basic Income would turn people into zoo
                animals to be farmed by the state.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This I kind of agree with.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Man was not meant to be farmed; man was meant to be useful, to
                be productive, to be proud.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Hmmm, useful to whom? Productive for what? We were not
              <strong>meant</strong> to be anything, we simply
              <strong>are</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>Being proud, without being arrogant, probably helps though.</p>
            <p>
              There are a lot of valid points in this section. But since he is
              saying markets support the welfare state, then they must be taxed
              and regulated, otherwise how will this support work. Not quite the
              free markets he is intending. Or else we understand different
              things in &quot;free markets&quot;.
            </p>
            <h2>The Techno-Capital Machine</h2>
            <p>
              Whole section reads like a description of Iain M Banks'
              <a href="https://www.robin.is/archive/tagged/iain-banks/"
                >Culture Series</a
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course that is science fiction and doesn't have to deal with
              the limited resources on planet earth. Nevermind the limits of
              physics and the physiology of our bodies.
            </p>
            <p>
              I can't help feeling that &quot;accelerationism&quot; as he calls
              it, doesn't quite lead to what he thinks. Acceleration tends to
              stretch things. If you are not careful, the link between those at
              the front doing the pulling (the few super rich), and those at the
              back being pulled along (the poor), risks breaking. We could end
              up living in an
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elysium_(film)">Elysium</a>
              style &quot;utopia&quot;.
            </p>
            <h2>Intelligence</h2>
            <p>
              Intelligence is inate. But being smart needs high quality
              education. Limiting high quality education to the rich, as is
              increasingly happening now, means the compound effect of
              &quot;intelligence * education&quot; is being woefully exploited.
              Since intelligence is inate, it is equally spread through the
              population. But when only one segment of the population gets to
              use that intelligence, you are missing out on an awful lot of
              intelligence.
            </p>
            <p>
              A lot of this chapter was like &quot;what is this guy on&quot;:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                as people form symbiotic relationships with machines into new
                cybernetic systems such as companies and networks;
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Of course AI can and is beneficial, but only because it is powered
              by human intelligence.
            </p>
            <h2>Energy</h2>
            <p>
              Fully agree with the point made on energy consumption in this
              section. We're not going to develop as a civilisation by using
              less energy. He also makes the point that using 1000x more energy
              does not need to be bad for the environment. I agree with that
              too.
            </p>
            <p>
              But then he says the current solution is nuclear fission. Whilst I
              don't disagree, I do think we need to urgently look beyond that
              technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              He raises the prospect of nuclear fusion. Hopefully he is right on
              this. It can't come soon enough.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                We believe technology is the solution to environmental
                degradation and crisis. A technologically advanced society
                improves the natural environment, a technologically stagnant
                society ruins it.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Whilst there are other ways in which an advanced society can ruin
              the environment which are not addressed by him (eg plastic
              pollution or habitat destruction), when it comes to energy, this
              is very true.
            </p>
            <h2>Abundance</h2>
            <p>
              This is the post-scarcity society of Iain M Banks culture series,
              which I already mentioned previously.
            </p>
            <p>
              The rest of this section makes sense, although I never like it
              when people are referred to as resources, even if they are
              &quot;ultimate resources&quot; in this case.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not sure we could support 50 billion people on planet earth, but
              if the age of abundance leads to a lack of need for material
              goods, maybe it could. But we would still need to eat and drink!
              And I hope we would not end up, perhaps even voluntarily, as
              batteries powering the matrix.
            </p>
            <h2>Not Utopia, But Close Enough</h2>
            <p>
              Fair enough, although this section doesn't really say anything
              concrete.
            </p>
            <h2>Becoming Technological Supermen</h2>
            <p>
              Nothing particularly outrageous here. All fairly obvious, but then
              couched in weird wording:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                We believe in the romance of technology, of industry. The eros
                of the train, the car, the electric light, the skyscraper. And
                the microchip, the neural network, the rocket, the split atom.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>And this:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                We believe in adventure. Undertaking the Hero‚Äôs Journey,
                rebelling against the status quo, mapping uncharted territory,
                conquering dragons, and bringing home the spoils for our
                community.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Does he even realise that he is the status quo?</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                We believe in nature, but we also believe in overcoming nature.
                We are not primitives, cowering in fear of the lightning bolt.
                We are the apex predator; the lightning works for us.
              </p>
              <p>

              up the tree of technological greatness.

              Merit is great, it's unfortunate that we increasingly live in a

              not equal merit.

              Again, it's unfortunate that our technological progress is making

              And freedom of thought is great, but how come then people are

              Yes, technology is inclusive, if used correctly. Of course AI
              giving the job to the white guy rather than the black one is not
              fair or inclusive. It is simply following what it is trained on,
              subjective and biased decisions overwhelmingly made by white
              folks.

              And of course, there are still many people without even a cheap

            <h2>The Meaning of Life</h2>
            <p>
              This section is true enough, but it hides behind this statement:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Techno-Optimism is a material philosophy, not a political
                philosophy.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              If this philosophy doesn't care about the politics, it then also
              doesn't have to care about the consequences of its theories. Which
              is quite handy, because everything has consequences.
            </p>
            <p>
              The main theory being that technology makes things better, on
              averge. This is probably true, but not better for everyone and not
              equally so. There are always winners and losers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Which leads to a big failing of this techno-optimist manifesto. It
              doesn't address the losers. It doesn't even address that there are
              losers. That is conveniently someone else's problem.
            </p>
            <h2>The Enemy</h2>
            <p>It starts off so well:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Our enemies are not bad people ‚Äì but rather bad ideas.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Then not so much goes downhill from there, but falls off a cliff.
              Pretty much any idea which doesn't fit into this guys pretty
              narrow world view is his enemy. Terrible.
            </p>
            <p>Finally, it takes on an almost missionary view:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                We believe we must help them find their way out of their
                self-imposed labyrinth of pain.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              The biggest enemy of progress are not all his enemies, but
              uniformity of thought, of philosophy, of ideas. If we all signed
              up to this guys manifesto, I am not sure things would turn out
              well for all of us. Certainly not in the short term, and there
              might not be a long term.
            </p>
            <h2>The Future</h2>
            <p>

              chapter.

            <p>
              I would argue, that above all else our civilisation was built on a

            <p>
              I don't think anybody really argues against building a world of
              ambition, abundance and adventure. The issue is around the ideas
              that enable us to do this.
