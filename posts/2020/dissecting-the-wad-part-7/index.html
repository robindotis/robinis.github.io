                paragraph 2, and shall be published on the relevant website.<br />For
                mobile applications, the accessibility statement shall be
                provided in an accessible format, using the model accessibility
                statement referred to in paragraph 2, and shall be available on
                the website of the public sector body that developed the mobile
                application concerned, or alongside other information available
                when downloading the application.<br />The statement shall
                include the following: <br />(a) an explanation concerning those

              which parts are of the website are accessible, and which
              aren&#8217;t and why not. Further the statement must contain a
              method allowing a person to notify the public sector body of a
              failure to meet the accessibility requirements and to request the
              information that is not accessible. Finally the statement must
              include the enforcement procedure to use, in case of an
              unsatisfactory response from the public sectory body.
