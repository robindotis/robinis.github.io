              There is quite a debate raging between
              <a
                href="http://www.zeldman.com/2010/11/19/%E2%98%85-to-my-friend-who-thinks-i-should-not-accept-awards/"
                >Jeffrey Zeldman</a
              >
              and
              <a
                href="http://www.informationarchitects.jp/en/open-letter-to-my-friend-zeldman/"
                >Oliver Reichenstein</a
              >
              about the value of the
              <a href="http://www.thenetawards.com/index.php">.net Awards</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The specific sticking point seems to be that Jeffrey was on the
              panel of judges and won the award "Standards Champion 2010" whilst
              <a href="http://happycog.com/">Happy Cog </a>won the award "Design
              Agency of the Year".¬† Nobody is claiming foul play. The debate is
              more centered around the value of these awards when Judges are
              also being nominated for and winning them. The other sticking
              point is the fact that it seems to be same group of people
              receiving nominations and awards every year.
            </p>
            <p>
              These awards are mainly about web design.¬† Design in this context,
              as pointed out by Oliver, is really all about communication and
              therefore those best at it will also be best at self-promotion.
              The awards reinforce this by magnifying that self promotion. The
              risk is¬† that designers start designing with the aim of winning an
              award rather creating what the client needs. A bit like bad
              politicians enter politics for the power it brings rather than
              because they actually want to make a difference. Maybe there are
              other ways of measuring the success of a design project, perhaps
              through stats. But these awards are recognising quality not
              quantity.
            </p>
            <p>
              An aspect of the debate is Jeffrey accepting the award "Standards
              Champion" for the third year in a row. I certainly don't begrudge
              Jeffrey accepting this award. He deserves it, although he
              personally has clearly stated that that award should have gone to
              <a href="http://adactio.com/">Jeremy Keith</a>.¬† I suppose a
              problem is that this award is designed for Jeffrey. There is no
              bigger standards champion. Period. (Although
              <a href="http://mollydotcom.tumblr.com/">Molly Holzschlag</a>
              comes a close second in my opinion). Can't they just award him the
              honorary title "Lord of Web Standards" and from now on give the
              .Net award for Standards Champion to someone else?
            </p>
            <p>
              One way of promoting lesser known designers for their work might
              be to have a subcategory in each of the personality focussed
              categories (Standards Champion, Design Agency, Web Personality and
              the podcast awards for a start) for up and coming designers.
              Perhaps this wouldn't be an award, perhaps it would be a
              nomination of five lesser known designers. I think this would be a
              good away of sayingt yes, we are picking the best, but we are also
              acknowledging others. And I suppose you should only be allowed to
              be nominated once in your life for such a "lesser known" designer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Personally I think complaining about the same designers winning
              these awards is like complaining that the same tennis players are
              always winning Wimbledon. Maybe there is some kind of "natural
              selection" going on. The best keep on getting better because they
              can more easily surround themselves with high quality colleagues
              (be it usability designers or tennis coaches) to help them get
              better still.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ultimately that is what is being awarded - continued self
              development and improvement in the field of web design.
