          </header>
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            I've been writing on the web since 1998, when I documented my
            <a href="/posts/2000/round-the-world-trip/">round the world trip</a
            >. Since then, this site has gone through several iterations. I
            thought it would be nice to document them here. It is, for me,
            interesting to note that the impetus to redesign my site seems to
            correlate quite well with switching jobs!
          </p>
          <h2>Version 1 (1998)</h2>
          <p>
            The <a href="/old/v1/frameset.htm">first version of my site</a>, put
            online in 1998, was hosted on the long ago defunct
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities"
              >GeoCities</a
            >. It is perhaps a good representation of sites from the late 90s,
            being frame based, part of a webring and generally looking
            uninteresing. Not to say that there weren't any interesting looking
            sites around at the time, but mine wasn't one of them. I did some
            blog style posts on football and Formula 1 at the time, but most of
            the site was about my round the world trip.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whilst I got started with this site on GeoCities, it wasn't long
            before the site was running under my own domain name
            <a href="http://robinmassart.com">robinmassart.com</a> using some
            static hosting space I bought on
            <a href="http://123-reg.co.uk">123-reg.co.uk</a> (as far as I
            remember). At this point I was working for Vega GmbH developing Web
            Based Training lessons to be used by Astronauts at the European
            Astronaut Centre.
          </p>
          <h2>Version 2 (2001)</h2>
          <p>
            The <a href="/old/v2/index.html">second version of my site</a>, went
            live around 2001 and was
            <a href="https://nearlyfreespeech.com"
              >self-hosted on nearlyfreespeech.com</a
            >
            since 2006, using PHP for the server side code. I was experimenting
            with layouts, javascript and all sorts of pointless fun. I even
            coded up a, still functional, game of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban">Sokoban</a> in
            JavaScript. I continued to blog a little about web development and
            document some of my travels. The site stayed the same for about 10
            years.
          </p>
          <p>
            This second version of my site was started whilst working for
            Dealogic in London and continued to be actively developed whilst I
            was living in Bulgaria in 2003. Interestingly work on the site
            completely stopped the moment I started developing websites for
            Minervation in 2004. Probably this hiatus was also due to the birth
            of my kids in 2005 and 2007.
          </p>
          <h2>Version 3 (2010)</h2>
          <p>
            For the <a href="/old/v3/">third version of my site</a>, online
            around 2010, I tried something different. I created a splash screen
            with links to content hosted elsewhere. Either on Twitter, Flickr,
            Facebook or on my WordPress blog. This seemed to follow a trend of
            the time, which was to not bother with self-hosting and all the work
            that goes with that. Whilst at first my Wordpress blog was
            self-hosted (on
            <a href="http://nearlyfreespeech.com">nearlyfreespeech.com</a> - see
            earlier), it didn't take long before I decided the effort involved
            wasn't worth it and migrated to
            <a href="https://wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            I also created another WordPress site called Cr8ive Eye to capture
            some of my attempted artwor at the time. That site no longer exists,
            but I copied the images to a post about the site, called
            <a href="/posts/2023/creative-eye/">Creative Eye</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was around about the time when responsive design and
            smartphones became a thing. This seems to have been an impetus to
            start blogging properly, although a lot of that was documenting the
            sites I was creating for Minervation. Coming to think of it, this
            blogging spree was also due to me entering a competition to work for
            the European Commission as a web developer in which I was
            successful. However, despite starting work at the Commission in late
            2012, it was many years before I did any web development related
            work there. Such is life.
          </p>
          <h2>Version 4 (2021)</h2>
          <p>
            This current version of my site went live in January 2021. Again, it
            feels like I am following a trend back to publishing in plain HTML
            and CSS. No server side application, it simply serves static pages.
            Since I have long ago stopped developing sites for a living, I can
            no longer follow the complexities of JavaScript frameworks. So this
            is a static site, developed using
            <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> on my laptop, versioned
            using <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, generated using
            GitHub Actions and hosted on GitHub Pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            It took me a couple of years to end up in this workflow, optimised
            for my needs. I posted quite a lot on this journey so won't repeat
            that here (see my posts on coding and web development in 2021 and
            2022). But to summarise, I went through several services to get
            here:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              my laptop for generating the files and the FTP'ing to the host,
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="http://nearlyfreespeech.com">nearlyfreespeech.com</a> for
              self hosting the static files,
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="http://netlify.com">netlify.com</a> for generating and
              hosting the files,
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="http://forestry.io">forestry.io</a> for authoring and
              configuring the site,
            </li>
            <li>
              not to mention all the other services I tried out and decided not
              to use.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The impetus for this redesign was that I finally started work on web
            development related topics at the European Commission: I
            <a
              href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/web-accessibility"
              >joined the team</a
            >
            responsbile for
            <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/2102/oj"
              >the Web Accessibility Directive</a
            >.
          </p>
          <h2>Future versions</h2>
          <p>
            I am writing this in early 2023. Looking back at the timeline it
            looks like I redevelop my site once a decade. So maybe in 2030 there
            will be a new version. What I like about the current site is that I
            am not tied into any specific content management system. All the
            content of the site is stored in plain text files in an open format,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I like to think though that the current format will last me a lot
            longer. The main dependency being Eleventy, but since that's open
            source, even if they stop developing that, I can still generate my
            files with it. Or write my own static file generator... don't get me
            started!
          </p>
