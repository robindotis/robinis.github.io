		<title>Safer Internet Day - 2023</title>
		<link href="https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/safer-internet-day-2023/"/>
		<updated>2023-02-10T13:18:27Z</updated>
		<id>https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/safer-internet-day-2023/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tuesday 7th February was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.saferinternetday.org/&quot;&gt;Safer Internet Day&lt;/a&gt; in 2023. It also marks the 20th year of the initiative, which is supported by the European Commission through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/safer-internet-day&quot;&gt;Safer Internet team of DG CONNECT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of that day, we arranged a morning in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lmrl.lu/&quot;&gt;Lycee Michel-Rodange&lt;/a&gt; in Luxembourg City, to let a class of the school try out the latest VR headsets from Meta. The kids, all around 15 years of age, got to try out five different VR worlds as they circulated around different stands in a class room. After that they had a brief discussion, giving their thoughts on VR in their futures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been a long time since I was in a class room full of 15 year olds and it was incredibly energising. They were all well behaved, whilst having their fun with the headsets. Maybe that is the Luxembourg effect!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best of all, in my opinion, was the lack of enthusiasm for this technology with these kids. Our polling showed they did not believe this technology would become an alternate world for them in the future. Whilst they saw the use of it in certain educational situations, few would be interested VR being their main medium of education. Despite growing up with always connected smartphones, they still apparently wanted face to face contact with their friends. They certainly didn&#39;t want to live in the VR world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own take on this, having tried out the headsets, is that they are simply not ready for the mainstream. The technology is too fiddly and, despite being relatively easy to use, is too cumbersome to do what appear to be basic things. I certainly can&#39;t see the advantage over a physical meeting with colleagues, or even a video-conference. There&#39;s still a long way to go before this tech can become mainstream. Maybe it never will, at least not in this form. And certainly not for entertainment or socialising purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The calm before the storm:&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let the VR begin:&lt;br /&gt;

		<title>European Bac choices toolkkit</title>
		<link href="https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/bac-choices/"/>
		<updated>2023-01-31T13:18:27Z</updated>
		<id>https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/bac-choices/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this week my younger daughter has to have chosen the subjects she wants to study for her European Baccalaureate. For those in the UK, this is equivalent to choosing your A levels, but much more complicated. This i not to say that it is easier, since these are always difficult choices. Just that there are subjects that are compulsory and more rules about which combination of subjects are not allowed. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.euroschool.lu/site/secondary-s6-s7-subject-choice-booklet/#1575669389394-aa74a39f-b3ba&quot;&gt;exact rules can be found here&lt;/a&gt;, but since that link is likely to break in the future, I recap them here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compulsory subjects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must take a number of compulsory subjects, which are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Language 1, 4 periods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Language 2, 3 periods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maths: either 3 or 5 periods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biology 2 periods
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unless Biology, Physics or Chemisty are taken as 4 period subjects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geography 2 periods
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unless taken as a 4 period subject&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History 2 periods
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unless taken as a 4 period subject&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Philiosophy 2 periods
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unless taken as a 4 period subject&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ethics 1 period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical Education 2 periods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Optional subjects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addtion you must choose a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 4 optional 4 period subjects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chemistry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Art&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geography&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Philosophy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Language 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economics or Latin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Language 4 or ONL (Other National Language)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Advanced subjects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also choose one advanced subject from the three available (in addition to their normal level):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced Language 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced Language 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced Maths
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only if Maths 5 period is chosen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all of the above (compulsory, optional and advanced), you must have a minimum of 29 periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Complementary subjects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also choose a range of complementary subjects, which are 2 periods each. I won&#39;t list them all here except that ones that have conditions attached to them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laboratory in Biology, Physics or Chemistry
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can only choose one of these and only if you are doing the equivalent 4 period subject&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction to Economics
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cannot be chosen if you have chosen 4 period economics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Total periods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of your chosen subjects must amount to at least 31 periods and maximum 35 periods. You can go slightly higher, but this needs permission from the school. You cannot go lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final exam choices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the above has important ramnifications for the subjects you are examined in at the end of the Bac. All the subjects count towards your bac, but those you choose to be examined in count much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot choose complementary subjects for these exams. If you choose one of the advanced subjects you must be examined in it. In addition there are written and oral exams, some of which cannot be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the written exams, of which you take five, your choices are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compulsory: Language 1 (or advanced if taken)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compulsory: Language 2 (or advanced if taken)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compulsory: Maths 3 or 5 period (depending on which you chose)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choice from:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two of the 4 period subjects you have chosen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition you cannot choose for the oral exams a subject you chose as one your choices for the 4 period subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the oral exams, of which you take three, your choices are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compulsory: Language 1 (or advanced if taken)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choice from:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Language 2 (or advanced if taken)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced is compulsory if chosen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History 2 or 4 periods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geography 2 or 4 periods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choice from:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most of the other 4 period subjects, unless chosen as the second option above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I explain all this because it means you might end up with no choices in the exams you have to take, depending on your subject choices for the bac. But understanding this can be quite complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I coded up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/html/bac-choices.html&quot;&gt;european bac subject toolkit&lt;/a&gt; to help my daughter visualise the consequences of her subject choices on the final bac exams she will have to take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I coded the entire toolkit without resorting to any frameworks or external scripts. These would have taken me much longer to learn than simply using vanilla JavaScript. What is good to see is how far in built browser support for lots of JavaScript functionality has come.  For this little toolkit using any kind of framework would have been complete overkill.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;by Octavia E. Butler&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The follow up book to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robin.is/posts/2022/parable-of-the-sower/&quot;&gt;Parable of the Sower&lt;/a&gt;. This is a fantastic read, possibly better still than the preceding novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story continues with the heroine trying to setup her Earthseed religion, but ending up enslaved, having her baby daughter taken from her before finally succeeding and her daughter finding her many years later. It might seem like a happy ending, but it is not so simple with internal family and religious feuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the name of the book, it is interesting to discuss which of the main characters is representing which of the servants in the biblical story of the same name as told in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_talents_or_minas#Parable_of_the_Talents&quot;&gt;Mathew 25:14-30&lt;/a&gt;. Or maybe such a link is not intended by the author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is also remarkably prescient of today&#39;s world, climate change, the religious right and especially of the years with Trump as president. Whilst we have avoided the apocalypse so far, the problems have not disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We were up in Pamporovo recently, staying at the lovely &lt;a href=&quot;https://malina-pamporovo.com/en/&quot;&gt;Villa Malina&lt;/a&gt;. I don&#39;t ski, so I&#39;ve never really seen ski pistes in the winter. There was no snow at all in the surrounding mountains. Yet a piste was there, created with artificial snow and being used by a lot of skiers. I know know how they market these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The marketing blurb&lt;/h2&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Discworld author Terry Pratchett died in 2015. His books were hugely popular, making him one of the most successfull authors of all time. To remember him, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/discworld/comments/2yt9j6/gnu_terry_pratchett/&quot;&gt;group of redditers&lt;/a&gt; came up with the idea of implementing the clacks  system from the book Going Postal in today&#39;s internet. This can done by adding the following bit of code to the &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; tag in any HTML file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;X-Clacks-Overhead&quot; content=&quot;GNU Terry Pratchett&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also be implemented by configuring web servers to send an appropriate page header. In fact this is the better option, but I am not able to configure the web server, as I am using GitHub Pages to host the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had implemented this years ago, whilst I still had my site running on Wordpress. After moving to a static site, I had forgotten about this and not added the clacks meta tag. Well, now it&#39;s back - just in time for the new year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information on the clacks headers is available here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnuterrypratchett.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.gnuterrypratchett.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site also lists a number of plugins which can notify you if you are visiting a site which has implemented the clacks header.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the easier to read culture novels. Told in an intersting way and without a predictable outcome whilst reading it, nor a clear answer to who did (or didn&#39;t) do it. What continues to impress is the way Iain M Banks is able to really drill home timeless infinity that defines our galaxy and the universe beyond it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The culture, whilst one of the more advanced and expansive civilisations in the galaxy, are portrayed as really just in their mid-20s. Very clever and important, but really not quite able to compete with those even more advanced.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Keywords meta tag</title>
		<link href="https://www.robin.is/posts/2022/keywords/"/>
		<updated>2022-12-27T08:58:47Z</updated>
		<id>https://www.robin.is/posts/2022/keywords/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just realised that on my posts I am not putting the tags in the &amp;quot;keywords&amp;quot; meta tag.  It&#39;s clear to me that search engines no longer use the keywords meta tag for indexing. Nevertheless, it feels like the right thing to do to me. I am not interested in search engine optimisation, at all. I would however like my site to be an example of good web practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So whilst populating the keywords meta tag is probably a waste of time in most cases, who knows, maybe in the future some crawler or indexer will use it for something. Or some researcher might find them usefull for cross checking against the content. And in any case, it&#39;s one line of code in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.dev/&quot;&gt;eleventy&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;meta name=&amp;quot;keywords&amp;quot; content=&amp;quot;posts,general,keywords,code,tags,information science,web&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I am old school, but I don&#39;t think we should be avoiding useful meta tags just because Google is not interested in them. In fact Google should maybe start paying attention to them, and rate sites down who&#39;s meta tag keywords don&#39;t match its own algorithm&#39;s keywords for the page.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Fixing blinds</title>
		<link href="https://www.robin.is/posts/2022/fixing-blinds/"/>
		<updated>2022-12-26T18:45:11Z</updated>
		<id>https://www.robin.is/posts/2022/fixing-blinds/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So today I fixed the third set of blinds in the top floor rooms since moving in five years ago. One room to go and then we should be good for a couple of decades!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, each time I fix them, I seem to take longer and longer to get the logic right so that the blinds are up when the strap is down and rolled around the spring at the bottom. So here are the steps I did this time, for my own future reference&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thread the strap through the little roller thingy as well as the slit on the right hand side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manually roll the blinds so they are all the way up. This is quite tough when they are fully down as you have to lift the weight of the entire blinds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a little helper to hold the blinds in place, whilst you thread the strap through the wheel on the right hand side and fix it in place by tying a knot at the end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let the blinds down, the strap should wind itself around the wheel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tug on the strap to make sure the blinds go up as you pull the strap down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Undo the box with the spring at the bottom and wind it up so the spring is tight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold everything roughly at the height where the box is attached to the wall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making sure the strap isn&#39;t twisted anywhere along its length, attach the strap on the little knob (cut a slit in the strap for this).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put the spring mechanism back in the box and screw the box to the wall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Job done, have a beer! üç∫&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here&#39;s a picture of the blinds half up, to prove that they now work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/blinds.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Blinds half way down the window at night, with reflections of the room in the window&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
