		<content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;by Suzanne Heywood&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This depicts the 10 years the author spent sailing around the world with her parents and younger brother. They departed England at the age of seven in their boat, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/wavewalker-suzanne-heywood/6898356?ean=9780008498498&quot;&gt;Wavewalker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s quite an adventure, including a near death experience in the Indian Ocean a couple of years into the trip. However the actual story of the book is that of a young girl spending the best 10 years of her youth lonely at sea, rather than socialising with friends at school.  Whilst the story turns out well, with the author going to Oxford University, the author is clear: this was not the idylic childhood her parents pretended she had and she has the psychological scars to show it. The fact that she coped so well is quite a miracle. She was more often than not neglected by her parents, both psychologically and physically. They essentially abandoned her in the middle of nowhere in New Zealand to look after her brother, whilst the parents continued sailing to &amp;quot;earn money&amp;quot;. She finally &amp;quot;escaped&amp;quot; to England for an interview at Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An easy read and well told story. I finished it whilst &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/inhope-malta/&quot;&gt;travelling to Malta&lt;/a&gt; and back. A little repetitive at times, but then I guess that is the point. The 10 years were not all fun and games. At all.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>INHOPE in Malta</title>
		<link href="https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/inhope-malta/"/>
		<updated>2023-04-28T07:47:29Z</updated>
		<id>https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/inhope-malta/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the last couple of days I was in Malta in order to give a presentation to &lt;a href=&quot;https://inhope.org/EN&quot;&gt;INHOPE&lt;/a&gt; on how to ensure their hotlines are accessible. I got there via a change in Frankfurt and returned the same way. The one thing I love about flying between Schengen countries is that there are no border controls. This meant that the only point I had to show my ID card during the whole trip was first in Luxembourg to check I am the person it says on my ticket when entering the security checks and then when checking in at the hotel. Fantastic! It makes getting out of airports so much easier, especially if you only have hand luggage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/malta-landing.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Landing in Malta&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a 25 minute taxi ride to the hotel I checked in and then explored the area a little. Getting to the conference venue would be a pleasant 15 minute stroll in the morning. The immediate area around my hotel, whilst OK, wasn&#39;t anything worth writing home about from a tourist point of view. But then this was a work trip!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/malta-st-julian.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Small maltese cove in the sunset&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference, which was actually an INHOPE Hotline Training Meeting took place in the Grand Ballroom of the Raddisson Blu.  I wasn&#39;t expecting this. Rarely giving presentations and if so maybe in front of 10 people or online, when I accepted to give the presentation I was expecting something quite small. When I was told it would be about 60 people, I assumed this was an exaggeration. It turned out to possibly be an underestimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/malta-grand-ballroom.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Grand Ballroom with three chandeliers with the screen at the back showing the slides&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day after the arrival I followed the conference with interest. In the evening I walked around a bit more, this time in the other direction (a little to the south-east), passed Spinola Bay and around St. Julian&#39;s Bay. I found that direction to be a little more interesting with a nicer beach walk. I caught a glimpse of the Balluta Building and the church next to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/malta-view-balluta.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Impressive art nouveau Balluta Building&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I returned to the hotel to prepare for my presentation the next morning. This went much better than I was expecting with a number of hotline representatives asking me to send them my presentation. After lunch, I went to the airport to catch my flight back. So I didn&#39;t get to see a lot of Malta. I enjoyed the sun and warmth and the somewhat arabic architecture of the buildings. The conference was insightful and my presentation a success. So overall a good two days away and on the flight back I got a nice view of the alps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/malta-alps.webp&quot; alt=&quot;View of the snow capped Alps through the airplane window&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Goodbye to Wordpress</title>
		<link href="https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/wordpress/"/>
		<updated>2023-04-13T09:33:27Z</updated>
		<id>https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/wordpress/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I deleted my remaining Wordpress sites and cancelled my Wordpress account. And so ends over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robin.is/history/&quot;&gt;13 years of Wordpress hosting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since moving my site to Eleventy, I had kept my two remaining Wordpress sites online only because an old post about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robin.is/posts/2013/epson-scan-window-wont-open/&quot;&gt;Epson printer window&lt;/a&gt; on one site was still quite popular. But that post no longer got any hits in the last couple of years, so it was OK to turn off the site. That left one remaining site where I had a collected a few paintings of mine. I copied those to this site as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/creative-eye/&quot;&gt;post called Creative Eye&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always liked &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt;, the internet&#39;s most successful CMS platform. It&#39;s open source nature and the philosophy of it&#39;s creator certainly appealed to me. It was easy to install when self-hosting and easy to use whether self-hosted or on &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;. And the price point was perfect: $0. Something I blogged about a while back when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robin.is/posts/2021/netlify-wordpress/&quot;&gt;comparing it to JAMStack sites&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in recent years I did find the act of writing a post got more complex than it needed to be. The Guttenberg editor was surely a reason for this. I never quite got the hang of it, even if I could understand the idea behind it. On top of this, the sheer number of options meant it was sometimes hard to find where to do what if you didn&#39;t use the tool regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I say goodbye to Wordpress not because it is a bad choice of CMS, but because I found a setup more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robin.is/posts/2022/replacing-forestry/&quot;&gt;suitable for my needs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Easter Weekend in Istanbul</title>
		<link href="https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/easter-in-istanbul/"/>
		<updated>2023-04-11T23:32:05Z</updated>
		<id>https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/easter-in-istanbul/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in March &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flypgs.com/en&quot;&gt;Pegasus airlines&lt;/a&gt; opened a new route from Plovdiv to Istanbul, so we thought we would give it a go when we went to Plovdiv for the Easter holidays. I booked some tickets ‚Ç¨70 return per person which seemed a reasonable price. I also booked the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/tr/sapphire.html&quot;&gt;Sapphire Hotel&lt;/a&gt; for three nights in the Fatih area of Istanbul, right next door to the Topkapi Palace, Ayasofya Mosque and the Sultanahmet Mosque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Arrival&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our flight landed on time in Sabiha G√∂kcen airport and we proceeded to the exit of gate 13 where the hotel said we will find our pre-booked transfer. What a welcome to Turkey that was! We found the right location, but there were many others looking for a transfer at the same location and we were approached by several drivers offering a transfer, none of whom seemed to know our name or our destination. Not having roaming, I was unable to contact the hotel. After some standing around, looking like useless tourists (which we were), we eventually managed to get a transfer for ‚Ç¨45, which was ‚Ç¨5 less than the hotel had stated us. And so began our adrenalin fueled taxi ride from another dimension...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got in the cab and set off, a short while later the cab driver pulled into a nearby petrol station to refuel. Not for petrol as you might expect, but for RedBull and cigarettes. And so the fun began. More thrilling than a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vdl.lu/fr/node/11240&quot;&gt;Schueberfouer&lt;/a&gt; ride, more dangerous than a shuttle launch and more scary than a Stephen King movie: our taxi driver was weaving in and out of traffic on the motorway into town, whilst holding a can of RedBull in one hand, a cigarette in the other, speaking to god knows who on one phone and using Google translate to give me the tourist highlights on another all whilst changing gears with the wrong hand. After too many &amp;quot;beyond close&amp;quot; calls with other cars on the road, including several where I thought &amp;quot;that was a nice life, unfortunatrly didn&#39;t quite make it to 50&amp;quot;, we promptly hit peak traffic around our hotel and didn&#39;t move for a good 20 minutes whilst we were a 15 minutes walk from our hotel! After several more twists and turns to get passed multiple cars on streets too narrow for even one car, the driver stopped, pulled in between two traffic cones and said: &amp;quot;this as close as I can get you, your hotel is down that road first on your left&amp;quot;. So we got out, I gave a ‚Ç¨5 tip and we got to our hotel a few minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 1 - Easter Sunday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started off on this cold, but sunny day, by walking around G√ºlhane park which is next to Topkapi palace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/gulhane-1.webp&quot; alt=&quot;G√ºlhane Sign&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tulips had been planted in the park for Istanbul&#39;s Tulip festival which is in the whole month of April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/gulhane-2.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Gulhane Tulips&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the northern end of the park we had a look at the Bosphorus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/bosphorus.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Bosphorus&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then headed back to the entrance of the Topkapi palace. Unfortunately the queues were so long we headed on to the Ayasofya Mosque only to be confronted by even longer queues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/ayasofya.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Ayasofya Mosque&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to be dispirited, we continued on to the Sultanahmet Mosque only to see that it was temporarily closed for restoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/sultanahmet.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Sultanahment Mosque&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would explain why the other two queues were so long. That and the fact the place was full of Easter weekend tourists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed onto the Mosaic Museum, via a nice market, but that was also shut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/spice-stall.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Market stall selling spice&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now it was time for lunch, which we had on a roof top terrace that afforded great views of both the Bosphorus and the Sultanahmet Mosque. The food was also very nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/sultanahmet-rooftop.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Sultanahmet from roof top&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having relaxed a bit on the terrace we headed to the spice market on the other side of the Fatih quarter. Whilst interesting, spice wasn&#39;t the only thing they sold here, which made it feel like just another market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/spice-market.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Spice market&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having failed to get into any of the mosques in the Topkapi palace area, we were happy to have a look inside the Yeni Mosque, just next to the spice market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/yeni-mosque.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Yeni Mosque&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here we could also see the Galata tower and were discussing on the merits of getting the tram across the bridge or walking when a guy managed to convince us to get on a one hour cruise around the Bosphorus. He gave us about 50% off the regular price, which we later realised was because it was probably the last cruise of the day and the boat was quite empty. Still, this meant we got good views as we sailed up and down a section of the Bosphorus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the riverside views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/galata-tower.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Galata Tower&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/yeni-rustem-mosques.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Yeni and R√ºstem Pasha mosques&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/asian-side-flag-tower.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Asian side with the largest mosque, flag and tower&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/flags.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Flags&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 2 - Easter Monday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our second day in Istanbul was essentially a day of cold and rain. The good thing about this was that it forced us to figure out the public transport and the benefits of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://istanbulepass.com/how-to-get-istanbul-kart.html&quot;&gt;Istanbul Card&lt;/a&gt;. The card costs 50TL and using it you get roughly half price fares compared to the regular fare. The best part being that you can share the card between five people, so no need to spend 200TL for the family just on cards. By sharing the card between the four of us, we recuperated the cost of the card after a couple of journeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we headed to Taksim square first on the tram and then up the hill with the funicular (which is a regular part of the public transport system and not a tourist thing). As it hadn&#39;t stopped raining, we stopped off in a nearby cafe for an hour or so and had a nice Turkish coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/taksim-square.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Taksim Square&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once it had more or less stopped raining we carried on walking through Taskim park, passed the technical university and down the hill along the Beshiktas football stadium and back to where we got off the tram. Since we hadn&#39;t yet been to the asian part (except for our mad taxi drive at the beginning) we got the ferry to the other side of the Bosphorus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/beshiktas-stadium.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Beshiktas Stadium&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the asian side we walked north-east along the riverside in the √úsk√ºdar district. Then we walked up the hill through a little park and back down to the ferry station along the main road. This gave us a better feel for what might be the more normal Istanbul away from the maddening tourist crowds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/uskundar-park.webp&quot; alt=&quot;√úsk√ºdar park&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We returned back to the Fatih district on the Marmaray train. This was an efficient, if dull, experience. It got us back to Fatih in about 3 minutes! Having spent the day getting around on various forms of public transport (tram, funicular, boat and train) I have to say that I am impressed with the public transport in this city. Still the roads are blocked full of cars! Maybe the day to day experience of public transport is different to the tourist one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended the day with a lovely meal in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/saluteistanbul/&quot;&gt;Salute Restaurant&lt;/a&gt;, 100 metres from our hotel. Definitely recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/fruit-salad.webp&quot;&gt;Desert fruit salad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 3 - Return home&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our flight home was in the late afternoon and checkout was at midday, so we walked around the Topkapi area in the hope of there being no queues after the easter weekend. We were mistaken, but did manage to get into the Sultan Ahmed Tomb which was nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/tomb.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Tomb&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we headed back to the hotel, grabbed our bags and got in the pre-booked taxi back to the airport. This time it was a normal drive along the motorway. No thrills, no danger, no scares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/bridge-taxi.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Bridge from Taxi&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The idea is to promote awarenes of web standards. A well designed site, following web standards, will work well without any styling. A follow-on aim is to raise awareness of accessibility, since the plain, unstyled website will feel more how someone with a screen reader and other assistive technology will experience the site.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Upgrading to Eleventy 2</title>
		<link href="https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/eleventy-2-upgrade/"/>
		<updated>2023-03-30T09:12:00Z</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This morning I upgraded this site to be generated using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.dev/blog/eleventy-v2/&quot;&gt;Eleventy 2.0.1&lt;/a&gt;. The process was dead simple thanks to this great &lt;a href=&quot;https://danabyerly.com/notes/upgrading-to-eleventy-2-0-0/&quot;&gt;post by Dana Byerly about the upgrade process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did however encounter one strange problem with &lt;a href=&quot;https://lodash.com/&quot;&gt;lodash&lt;/a&gt;. After following the first three steps and then running the build command I received errors from npm about the missing &amp;quot;lodash&amp;quot; module. So I looked in my local node_modules and the only relevant folder there was &amp;quot;lodash.deburr&amp;quot;. I am not sure why, or even what the difference is between the two. Possibly this was something which worked in eleventy 1.0 but no longer in eleventy 2.0, no idea. So I ran &lt;code&gt;npm install lodash&lt;/code&gt; and then continued with step 4 and everything was fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I need to see how to take advantage of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://11ty.rocks/posts/new-features-upgrade-considerations-eleventy-version-2/&quot;&gt;new features in Eleventy 2.0&lt;/a&gt;, starting with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.dev/docs/usage/incremental/&quot;&gt;incremental builds&lt;/a&gt; during development.&lt;/p&gt;
