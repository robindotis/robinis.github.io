&lt;p&gt;An interesting read about how basic human psychology affects the daily life of all of us in much the same way. We shouldn&#39;t take the actions of others personally. Rather, we should think of them as reaction to the inner problems of others. Probably we should have pity on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise all our freakish, perverted and non-sensical thoughts are actually perfectly normal. Everyone has similar thoughts going through their heads more or less all the same time. It&#39;s not just us. Our worries and anxietes? It&#39;s not just us, it&#39;s everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sentence from the end of the book is a good summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all, where it counts, steering almost blind&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or as I like to think of it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost everyone, almost of the time, is just winging it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

		<title>Manifest - again</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I started watching a Netflix series called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8421350/&quot;&gt;Manifest&lt;/a&gt; back in Summer last year. Today I completed watching it after they released the final 10 episodes a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robin.is/posts/2022/manifest/&quot;&gt;previous post on the series&lt;/a&gt;, the series got a bit repetitive with the heroes following calling after calling without any real or obvious development towards an end. Nevertheless I wanted to see the conclusion of this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
    &lt;summary&gt;Spoiler Alert!&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, given the tendency for happy endings in Hollywood this one was not hard to guess in advance. The plane returns back where it came from and lands as it should have done in 2013. Whilst the passengers on the plane still know what has happened, those greeting them do not. Which leads to an interesting final few minutes as the individual story lines are wrapped up with what the passengers learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, nowadays no series ends without a chance for a spin off. Those passengers who could not redeem themselves in the five and half years during which they were gone have disappeared from the plane. The series ends with the same FBI agent who was the lead in investigating the dissapearance of the plane, now turning up to investigate the dissapearance of the 11 missing passengers.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Public luxury, Private sufficiency</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I read an interesting article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/the-planets-economist-has-kate-raworth-found-a-model-for-sustainable-living&quot;&gt;Kate Raworth and her Doughnut Economics book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea is worth repeating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;public luxury and private sufficiency&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea being that shared public life and infrastructure should be rich and luxurious, whereas in private we should all be sufficient, consuming as little as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example is building large cycle lanes and good public transport systems at the expense of the private car.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Bridel Circular Walk</title>
		<link href="https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/bridel-circular-walk/"/>
		<updated>2023-05-28T11:43:28Z</updated>
		<id>https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/bridel-circular-walk/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This was a simple 8.3km &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visitluxembourg.com/tour/circular-walk-bridel&quot;&gt;circular walk through the woods around Bridel and Kopstal&lt;/a&gt;. It was a lovely warm sunny Sunday morning day for fast paced walk with Angie. The page said the route takes two hours 20 minutes, but it took me and Angie only one hour and 45 minutes, which is what I would have expected for an 8km walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walk itself was really easy with only slight inclines, almost all of it in the shade, so Angie loved it.  Unusually for these circular walks, there wasn&#39;t really any view or historical point of interest. There was however some interesting information on the local water systems and how rainwater gets converted into drinking water. On this image is a German poem about the process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/bridel-1.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Der Luxemburger Sandstein, In den Kl√ºften und Spalten wird das Grundwasser gefiltert, In der Tiefe wird das Grundwasser gespeichert, Dar Grundwasser tritt in den Quellen im Mamertal zu Tage.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In English this means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Luxembourg Sandstone&lt;br /&gt;
The ground water is filtered in the chasms and cracks&lt;br /&gt;
The ground water is stored in the deep&lt;br /&gt;
The ground water comes into the daylight in the Mamer valley&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

		<title>Improving the pipeline</title>
		<link href="https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/publication-pipeline/"/>
		<updated>2023-05-24T07:12:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/publication-pipeline/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since moving this site to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.dev/&quot;&gt;Eleventy&lt;/a&gt; back in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robin.is/posts/2021/welcome-back/&quot;&gt;December 2020&lt;/a&gt; I&#39;ve been continually improving my publication pipeline. It started out being a manual process running bits of hacked together code on my laptop before switching to my online tool of the day for pushing the changes to the hosted site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time I was using &lt;a href=&quot;https://tina.io/forestry/&quot;&gt;Forestry.io&lt;/a&gt; which is now discontinued and I never really took to it&#39;s replacement. So I settled on simply using Github for everything. This means the source for code is pushed from my laptop to  Github, the published site is on Github Pages and the processing for creating the site from the source is managed through Github Actions. Initiallly triggering these three parts were things I did manually and separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I soon started scripting these actions in Powershell. The first script simply pushed the changes to github. I modified this to include a pull from github before the push, to ensure there were no conflicts when pushing. After running the script, I would manually switch to GitHub to run the workkflow in GitHub Actions that actually updated the site with the changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, yesterday I finally added that task to the script as well. Using the GitHub Rest API is straighforward and creating the correct curl command was relatively easy. But I don&#39;t know much about curl and in any case the script is a powershell script. Some Googling (mainly using Bing üôÇ) got me most of the way there, by using the &lt;code&gt;Invoke-RestMethod&lt;/code&gt;. But I wasn&#39;t sure how to add one property to the command. Thankfully I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/73773558/131948&quot;&gt;a code snippet on Stackoverflow&lt;/a&gt; which gave me what I needed. It had no explanations or comments, it was just posted as an answer to a question as is. Nevertheless it solved my problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so this post becomes the first one pushed to GitHub and published on GitHub Pages using one integrated script. üëè&lt;/p&gt;

Personally I would go for the 2003 touchscreen, but I can understand the convenience of a tablet which the staff can carry around. But is that really an improvement on a pen and paper? ü§î&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>John Greenwood</title>
		<link href="https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/john-greenwood/"/>
		<updated>2023-05-02T07:23:28Z</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Racing&#39;s in the family. John Greenwood is a relative of the family on my mother&#39;s side. He was a successfull Speedway racer until a racing accident left him with one arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/john-greenwood.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Eight Monarchs team speedway racers posing for a team photo with three in the front and five at the back. Back row: Roy Bester, Eddie Lack, Johnny Greenwood, Dick Campbell, Bert Clark. Kneeling on the front row: Don Cuppleditch, Bob Mark, Jimmy Cox.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image and text taken from an article by John Hyam on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.speedwaymuseumonline.co.uk/johngreenwood.html&quot;&gt;Speedway Museum Online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s the article so I have a local copy in case that link breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ONE of speedway&#39;s tragedies is when a potentially brilliant career is shattered by injury. There have been many instances over the years, and one that especially stands out in my mind concerns Johnny Greenwood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was just 21 years old when his career came to a shuddering end in 1956 more than 6,000 miles away from his home at Keighley in Yorkshire. It happened at Adelaide when he broke his right arm which was left partially paralysed bringing an abrupt end to a promising career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Walsh, a former cycle speedway rider from Keighley in Yorkshire, has been a lifelong friend of Greenwood. Bill said, &amp;quot;I first met Johnny when we were pupils at Keighley Boys Grammar School and we are still in regular contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He was taken to ride in Australia by Fred Tracey, the old Walthamstow and Coventry rider, who was then the Melbourne promoter. He did so well at Melbourne that it was decided to take Johnny on to race at Adelaide where Jack Young was the big star. And Johnny&#39;s winning ways meant that he was soon a backmarker off 200 yards in handicap races. Only Young was given a bigger handicap - 20 yards behind Greenwood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;On the night of his accident, Johnny was going for an unbeaten run. In his last race of the meeting he passed Bob &#39;Cowboy&#39; Sharp on the third lap to go in front. Then, for some unexplained reason, Johnny seemed to lose concentration and slammed into the safety fence on the third bend of the last lap.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walsh added, &amp;quot;He was badly injured and severely damaged the nerves in his arm which eventually led to the permanent loss of it. At 21 it was as bad as it could get.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a 17-year-old. Greenwood had been a protege of Ernie Appleby at his Newton Heath training track near Manchester in 1953. Before the year was out Johnny had rides with Liverpool in National League Division Two, then finished the season at Southern League track St Austell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of 1954, Greenwood was with Edinburgh in their brief early season in the National League Division Two where he averaged 8.29 points in four league matches. His debut meeting at Meadowbank was in a pairs event where he took 13 points in his five rides and only renowned Scottish stars Ken McKinlay and Don Cuppleditch beat him. It made Greenwood an overnight favourite with Monarchs&#39; fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A feature of Greenwood&#39;s brief spell at Edinburgh was his fiery style of riding when partnered with Don Cuppleditch.  When Cuppleditch led in races, Greenwood was always hot on his tail, but when the placings were reversed there was no way the heat leader could get back in front. And when Edinburgh faced Leicester in the National Trophy, Greenwood returned paid double figure scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A feature of Greenwood&#39;s attitude to racing was that he hated to be passed when in front. McKinlay once said, &amp;quot;After a race in which he had been overtaken, Johnny asked me to explain just how his rival had managed to get past him. He was a true racer and dedicated to winning.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closure of Edinburgh early in the season saw Greenwood move to Exeter, before the calls of National Service took him to Iraq for two years. Upon demob and with the 1956 season coming to an end, Greenwood joined Division One side Bradford, making just two appearances. And it was while racing at Bradford that Aussie track boss Fred Tracey was captivated by the youngster&#39;s spectacular style and invited him to go to Australia - a venture that was to end his racing career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The serious injury did not see an end to Greenwood&#39;s love of life generally nor of speedway. He married and raised two sons and still takes a keen interest in speedway at Grand Prix level, and especially likes to see the meetings in Poland. Additionally, he is an enthusiastic member of the World Speedway Riders Association.&lt;/p&gt;
