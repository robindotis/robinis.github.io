		<title>The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas</title>

&lt;p&gt;This is a very interesting and thought provoking short story about citizens living in a Utopia, called Omelas, enabled through the continuous misery of one child. It doesn&#39;t go into the technicalities of how this works, but makes the reader think about what they would do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some citizens rationalise keeping the status quo in various ways: The miserable child probably would not get much better if let free; Freeing the child would prevent other works of brilliance and beauty from existing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others, upon seing the misery of the child, simply walk down the street, keep walking and walking and eventually leave Omelas. They are The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas. The author states that the place they head to is even less imagineable than Omelas. I take this as a hint that it might be better. Meaning that if you have the courage to walk away from something apparently wonderful, yet disagreeable , you might actually reach somewhere even better.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The Dispossessed</title>

&lt;p&gt;I read this book straight after reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robin.is/posts/2024/the-left-hand-of-darkness/&quot;&gt;The Left Hand of Darkness&lt;/a&gt; by the same author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book tells the story of the invention of the ansible, which allows for instantaneous communication (but not travel) across solar systems. It covers three different civilisations spread across several plantes. These are the anarchists on Anarres, the propertarians on Urras, the Terrans (surviving on Earth earth afte climate collapse reduced their population from 9 billion to 500 million) and the Hainish, which at several thousands of millenia is the oldest civilisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a very insightful critique of different political systems such as capitalism, communism and anarchism without actually taking sides. They all have their faults and all have their benefits. The book also encourages you to think about how these systems could interact going foward as purposefully it does not come to a clear conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I particularly liked that part of the ending with the Hainish commander Ketho being curious to visit the young anarchist civilisation on Anarres. Despite warnings from Shevek that his safety could not be guaranteed he insisted on visiting, not because anarchy was something new to his civilisation, far from it. But because his civilisation was 100s of millenia old and whilst it had tried anarchy, he personally had not experienced it. As he said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The there is nothing new under any sun. But if each life is not new, wach single life, then why are we born?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way I understand it he basically wanted to experience a youthful civilisation, given the age of his own, Hainish, society.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Summer in Plovdiv</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The forecast looked like this for our usual summer visit to Plovdiv:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2024/summer-in-plovdiv-1.webp&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; width=&quot;496&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for us it was slightly wrong as it was hotter than forecast! This meant staying inside after midday. It also meant our vague plans to go anywhere never really materialised as it was too hot to think of anything and by the time we had planned to cool down in the mountains their weather forecast was thunderstorms for the next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we hung around in Plovdiv which was also relaxing. The city had organised a few events in the evening. Which was nice, even in the evening heat. One was this stand up comedy just next to the Dzhumaya mosque.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Adding sidebar</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve slightly redesigned the layout of the site by moving the header menu to the left hand side of the screen. You won&#39;t see this on mobile, but you will on larger screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also added slash in front of the menu items so that it shows that they are actual folders of the site, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robin.is/writing/&quot;&gt;robin.is/writing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this is not a huge change, but I like the altered layout, which I achieved with under 30 CSS statements and almost no HTML changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continue to be amazed at what can be achieved nowadays in CSS without having to alter the HTML, assuming a well structured HTML web page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book took me much longer than it should have to read. It&#39;s interesting, but perhaps that is why I was not so captivated by it. If I had read it in a couple of days it might have been more meaningful. Still, the story of spacefaring humans making first contact with this planet of ice and snow is well worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Testing Git based CMSs</title>
		<link href="https://www.robin.is/posts/2024/testing-git-based-cmss/"/>
		<updated>2024-06-06T15:28:11Z</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every now and then I am looking for a better editing experience for my website content. Currently I am simply editing the content either directly in GitHub or else in Visual Studio Code. This is fine, about the only inconvenience is dealing with image uploads: resizing, optimising and adding to the content. The last time I looked into a CMS was about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robin.is/posts/2022/alternatives-to-forestry/&quot;&gt;18 months  ago&lt;/a&gt;. My requirements from back then haven&#39;t really changed, although I am now willing to pay for the CMS if it is really going to simplify my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I have come across two open source projects which look promising:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pagescms.org/&quot;&gt;Pages CMS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms&quot;&gt;Sveltia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are in fact quite similar and can be added to a website without needing a real host, they use netlify or cloudflare for the GitHub authentication parts, the rest is client side code. In fact Sveltia is a fork of &lt;a href=&quot;https://decapcms.org/&quot;&gt;Decap CMS&lt;/a&gt;, which itself is a rebrand of the no longer supported Netlify CMS. Both do a nice job of putting a front end on the GitHub experience, but neither seems to fit in too well with my specificities out of the box (eg collections and assets that contain sub folders). Getting them to work through Cloudflare also takes some fiddling, but it does work in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still miss &lt;a href=&quot;https://tina.io/forestry/&quot;&gt;Forestry&lt;/a&gt;, which was replaced by &lt;a href=&quot;http://tina.io/&quot;&gt;Tina.io&lt;/a&gt;, but that is too focussed on Next.js sites for my liking.  I decided to give &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudcannon.com/&quot;&gt;CloudCannon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://strapi.io/&quot;&gt;Strapi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sanity.io/&quot;&gt;Sanity&lt;/a&gt; another look. But they either had too many proprietary aspects (Sanity), needed to be self hosted (Strapi) or just not quite what I wanted (CloudCannon). I guess I will just have to stick with GitHub and VSC. No harm done.&lt;/p&gt;
