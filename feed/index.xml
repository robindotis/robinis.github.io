		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A lovely short weekend in London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Saturday we walked around the Bloomsbury area, having a great late lunch in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gigsfishandchips.com/&quot;&gt;Gigs&lt;/a&gt; near Goodge Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late afternoon, we walked around the last day of the winter lights exhibition at Canary Wharf, before watching Les Miserables at the Sondheim Theatre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2024/london-weekend-1.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Looking up at the HSBC building from within the winter lights exhibition&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Can&#39;t we just print more money</title>
		<link href="https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/cant-we-just-print-more-money/"/>
		<updated>2023-12-31T23:00:33Z</updated>
		<id>https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/cant-we-just-print-more-money/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;by Rupal Patel and Jack Meaning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A book on introductory economics written by employees of the The Bank of England. Very easy to read and generally easy to follow. Understanding some of the theory without some background knowledge of economics might be difficult though. The book could have paid more attention to explaining some of the terminology and concepts. Still it is a good book to get a better understanding of some of the everyday questions on economics you might have. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What causes recessions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is inflation and is it good or bad?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is money?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are banks useful?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should governments be in debt?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the book&#39;s title: Can&#39;t we just print more money?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some criticism is due because it tends to support the status quo, along the lines of &amp;quot;it is what it is&amp;quot;. It is honest enough to stress that economics is not a real science and very much hit and miss. It also finishes with a &amp;quot;call to arms&amp;quot;, trying to get more people interested in economics in order to shake up the status quo. More discussions on some of the social consequences of the choices available to governments, banks and economists would have been useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the different types of taxes that can be raised and from whom. Taxing the very rich or companies has very different consequences to taxing the poor. If the aim is to keep money in the system, then there needs to be a way to limit the very rich from taking it out of the system and put it in offshore bank accounts for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the US can run much larger debt ratio than other countries, because of its political and military importance. Similarly, Japan has the highest debt ratio in the world, but this is not a problem because much of it is held by its citizens and generally the world trusts Japan to repay its debt. So again, like taxes, not all debt is equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book does hint at these sorts of questions in the conclusion and it is intended as an introduction, not a study. It also mentions that most of the public does not understand the consequences of the economic policies they are voting for. Addressing things like taxation and debt in more detail, but still in plain language, might have been useful in achieving the goals of the book.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Count Zero</title>

&lt;p&gt;Count Zero is the follow on book to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/neuromancer/&quot;&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/a&gt;, which I read last month. It took me a little longer to finish, so I think I missed some of the detail. It was an interesting read, possibly more so even than Neuromancer, although not as ground breaking. I think I will have to re-read this one in a shorter time frame to make more sense of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Started 13/11/2023. Finished 22/12/2023.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Angie&#39;s Christmas Tale</title>
		<link href="https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/angies-christmas-tale/"/>
		<updated>2023-12-20T13:18:27Z</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This morning, walking Angie in one of the locations we rarely go to, Angie disappeared. I was walking ahead as usual, she was dilly dallying at the back. When I retraced my steps to go and find her, she was gone. After about half an hour of whistling and shouting I started to get quite worried. I went back to the car to see if she was there, then I called my wife to come back from work to help find her. I also called a nearby neighbour who I know from walking our dogs. She came and helped look with her dog, Tashi. But all to no good. She phoned her bedsitter to check if Angie had returned to our house. No luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neighbour went back to the village, and opened the gate to our garden so Angie could go in, if she returned. At that time my wife had returned home as well and between them half the village was now looking for Angie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime I went back to my car and drove down the hill to the houses below where we were walking. This was about 90 minutes after she went missing. Walking around there, a lady came out of one of the houses, asking if I was looking for a dog. I said yes, and she mentioned that another lady, a teacher, had found a dog and put her in her van and gone to work at the school. The teacher had given the lady her phone number. So I got in touch with the teacher and started heading to the school she worked at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out the teacher had already posted a message on Facebook which our direct neighbour had already seen, recognised Angie, contacted the teacher separately and was heading to the school with my wife. I followed along and we were reunited with Angie about two and half hours after she went missing. They&#39;d even cleaned her! I guess dirty dogs are not allowed in schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very nice to see how quickly things can come together when everyone helps - and how social media can actually be put to good use as well from time to time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is my Christmas Tale for 2023. üéÖüéÑ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/angies-christmas-tale.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Angie waiting to be picked up&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Progressive Web App</title>
		<link href="https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/installable/"/>
		<updated>2023-12-09T08:18:27Z</updated>
		<id>https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/installable/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I decided to make my website installable, so it can be added to a device as an installed application. The way to do this is to add some javascript to the site so that it is a Progressive Web App (PWA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be a PWA, a website needs only one thing: a &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.dev/learn/pwa/service-workers/&quot;&gt;service worker&lt;/a&gt;. Adding one is fairly straightforward, once you know how. It does require a good understanding of asynchronous JavaScript, something which I struggle with. The alternative is just to copy someone else&#39;s service worker code and adapt if needed. I chose the alternative. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I copied the one from &lt;a href=&quot;https://adactio.com/&quot;&gt;Jeremy Keith&lt;/a&gt;. It took me a while to get it to work, although I am not sure I really changed anything very much. However, debugging PWAs is more complex than plain JavaScript. So most of my efforts were trial and error. And then it worked. Magic! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I even managed to get an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robin.is/offline/&quot;&gt;offline page&lt;/a&gt; working for the PWA. Again, copied from &lt;a href=&quot;https://adactio.com/offline&quot;&gt;Jeremy&#39;s offline page&lt;/a&gt;. What this page does, thanks to some nifty JavaScript, is check if there is a network connection. If there is it fetches the page from the server. If there isn&#39;t, it tries to fetch the page from the cache. If the page has not been cached, it displays a list of pages that have been cached and are therefore available for offline reading. Fantastic!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Dependencies</title>
		<link href="https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/dependencies/"/>
		<updated>2023-11-29T08:18:27Z</updated>
		<id>https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/dependencies/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Dependencies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges, at least for me, in modern web development, is keeping track of dependencies. On the one hand they help you avoid reinventing the wheel. On the otherhand they can cause unexpected problems which are sometimes hard to diagnose. I like to keep them to a minimum, especially when I don&#39;t really understand how they do what they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I improved my GitHub action that builds my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.dev/&quot;&gt;eleventy&lt;/a&gt; based website by removing my dependency on an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/TartanLlama/actions-eleventy&quot;&gt;action from a GitHub user called TartanLlama&lt;/a&gt;. This action used a Docker file to build and generate the actual HTML pages for the website. The action has served me well for the last three years, but I did worry about what would happen if there was a bug and the user stopped maintaining this bit of code. It had stopped working once and it took me a couple of days to realise that I had to update my link to the action to a newer version. I didn&#39;t want to end up in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robin.is/posts/2022/dependency/&quot;&gt;this situation&lt;/a&gt;, should the user decide to call it a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I did some Googling and found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rockyourcode.com/how-to-deploy-eleventy-to-github-pages-with-github-actions/&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/75599084&quot;&gt;this answer on Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/stackoverflow/&quot;&gt;Yes, I know I am trying to avoid Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;, but Google makes it very hard!). Between the two, I came up with this step in my GitHub action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- name: Install dependencies &amp;amp; build
    run: |
        npm install --package-lock-only
        npm ci
        npm run build  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years I&#39;d heard a lot about this book. The author coined the term &amp;quot;cyberspace&amp;quot; and basically invented the cyberpunk genre. Back in the early 80s. So I finally decided I should read it and it made a very suitable follow up to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/androids-sheep/&quot;&gt;previous book&lt;/a&gt; I read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a fun read. I can see why it is so popular and how it would be a genre defining book. Very timely as well, with the rise of AI over the last year or two. Although that AI is nothing compared to what is described in this story. In fact the book is a suitable reminder that what we consider as AI right now, is nothing of the sort. It&#39;s certainly not intelligent, let alone self-aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished the last quarter of the book in one evening. On putting it down and thinking about it for a while, there were more questions than answers. But the one thought which I couldn&#39;t get out of my mind, is that this was basically a blue print for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/&quot;&gt;The Matrix&lt;/a&gt;. Reading other people&#39;s thoughts on the web, I am clearly not the only one who came to this conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently this book is part of a trilogoy. I guess they&#39;ll be my next two reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Started 03/11/2023. Finished 12/11/2023.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Stack Overflow</title>
		<link href="https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/stackoverflow/"/>
		<updated>2023-11-09T07:00:01Z</updated>
		<id>https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/stackoverflow/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I deleted all my accounts on stack overlfow and the other stack exchange sites. Why? I hadn&#39;t posted a question on the site in over 10 years as I no longer program very much and I find the answer increasingly less relevant when I am looking for something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve also come to understand  how its kudos system has a lot of negative side effects, turning what should be a friendly Q&amp;amp;A site into an agressively moderated online environment which is especially toxic to newbies who don&#39;t understand the rules. I had noticed myself that answers I gave over a decade ago were constantly re-edited and &amp;quot;improved&amp;quot;. Some questions I asked got completely rewritten or marked as duplicate even though I felt they weren&#39;t. This is the effect of members chasing kudos points in order to stay relevant in site&#39;s user rankings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also noticed that all search engines rely heavily, almost exclusively, on Stack Overflow to provide answers to programming questions asked to them. The problem which arises, is that the best answer from 10 years ago may no longer actually be the best answer. This is especially the case in web design where accepted best practice has moved on so much that an answer from 10 years ago is often simply no longer relevant. However, because the answer was edited 2 years ago the search engines still think it is up to date. This leads me to believe that the whole Q&amp;amp;A ecosystem created by Stack Overflow reeks of gaming the system. To the detriment of the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think the founders knew this. They &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/06/02/prosus-acquires-stack-overflow/&quot;&gt;sold the site for a cool $1.8 billion&lt;/a&gt; a couple of years ago, back in 2021. I think they realised they&#39;d pushed this as far as they could and in the long term further growth would be difficult. The new owners will for sure make a good profit over the coming years, it is after all &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; go to site for programming answers. But I doubt the next 15 years will match the success of the previous 15 years.  I can&#39;t see it maintaining its relevance, especially in this age of AI and tools like Copilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I for one, intend to avoid the stack exchange network as much as I can in future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the book on which the film Blade Runner is based. I have always struggled to stay awake watching the film, as despite being interesting, it is very slow paced. The book on the other hand I finished in a couple of days. It&#39;s not gripping, but definitely interesting and raising some interesting questions about what is and isn&#39;t real. With the progress of AI in recent years, this is again a very current question. Well worth reading. And maybe I should watch the film again...&lt;/p&gt;
