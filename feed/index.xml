&lt;p&gt;The 8th book in Iain M Banks&#39; series of Culture novels. It took me 2 and half months to slog through this book. Somehow I could not get into it eventhough the idea behind the Shellworlds is quite incredible. What I do like about the Culture novels is that even if the plot is not your thing, each book reveals a little more about the galaxy within which the Culture civilisation operates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story itself is OK in this book, perhaps not one of the better culture series storylines, but stil enjoyable. However it was not always captivating enough to keep me going. So I ended up putting it down for weeks at a time. I seemed to read it in spurts, including the last 100 pages on a Friday afternoon when work was slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best summary of this book I&#39;ve seen is &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/wjou9/comment/c5dyx5d/&quot;&gt;Matter lacked substance&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Follow the Money</title>

&lt;p&gt;This is an easy to follow whirlwind tour of where the UK government gets its money from and how it spends it. Full of facts and figures as well as some insightful commentary and significant critiscism of past taxation decisions across all parties. The biggest one being the lack of consistency, closely followed by lack of foresight and unwillngness to challenge current vested interests to improve the future of the country overall. Note that the latter is less about big business and lobbying and more about not wanting to upset the electorate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely worth a read as it won&#39;t take you long. It took me a week. But what is missing is any real solution to these problems. Politicians have to win elections every few years so taking decisions which make some people poorer in the short term, but others better off in the long term is hard if you want to be re-elected. This conunmdrum is not solved by the book, which finishes with lots of good tips none of which will necessarily lead to an election victory in the current political climate. It finishes with the simple comment &amp;quot;must do better if we are to cope with the next crisis&amp;quot;. (Which, according to the book is going to be the climate crisis hitting at the same time as a really ageing population comes along.)&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.websitecarbon.com/&quot;&gt;Website Carbon Calculator&lt;/a&gt; each view of this site&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/robin-is/&quot;&gt;homepage produces 0.07g of CO2&lt;/a&gt;. It is therefore cleaner than 94% of web pages tested. Hurray!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing with other sites, it seems like the main component of this calculation is filesize. The homepage is about 300kB, depending on how many images happen to be on it. The biggest permanent component is the font file, which is 134kB and therefore contributes over a third of the CO2 prodcued by this homepage without actually contributing much to the function and usability of the site. Is the font file necessary? Perhaps I should switch back to using Arial? It&#39;s interesting how seemingly innocent design choices can have such an impact on the environment. For now it will stay as pretty much no one looks at this site.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The 9th April is &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-naked-day.github.io/&quot;&gt;CSS Naked Day&lt;/a&gt;. On this day many bloggers remove all styling from their blog. The idea is to promote awarenes of web standards. A well designed site, following web standards, will work well without any styling. A follow-on aim is to raise awareness of accessibility, since the plain, unstyled website will feel more how someone with a screen reader and other assistive technology will experience the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In preparation for this, have updated my &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/robindotis/54786199b5d86f5085e5c55337d6e0d0&quot;&gt;theme picker&lt;/a&gt; to incldue a hard coded &amp;quot;Naked&amp;quot; CSS theme. If desired, this theme will be forced on CSS Naked Day, with no alternative for the end user.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Sveta Petka</title>
		<link href="https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/sveta-petka/"/>
		<updated>2023-02-19T22:18:27Z</updated>
		<id>https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/sveta-petka/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Twenty years after my last walk to Sveta Petka monastery in the hills above Asenovgrad, I did the same again. This is a religious day specific to the monastery and it started appropriately by saving the life of a dog. This poor chap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/sveta-petka-dog.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Dog resting in dried grass in front of a monastery&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;had fallen into a reservoir and couldn&#39;t climb out of the water due to the steep smooth concrete banks. So the tallest guy in our group, held by two others, climbed over the barrier and pulled the dog out of the water. We gave the dog some bread and went on our way up the steep hill to the monastery. At the top we saw the dog resting in front of the official ceremony of the monastery. Holy dog indeed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sveta Petka monastery is known for being a hiding place for Bulgarian revolutionary, Vasil Levski. I saw his hiding place 20 years ago, so didn&#39;t queue this timee to see it, but the monastery itself is reasonably well maintained, with on-going construction works and well worth a visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We carried on past the monastery, through masses of people and found a spot about about a few hundred metres further along. Actually, we didn&#39;t find it, it&#39;s where the group always has their picnic on this hike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time I got there the others had already started the fire!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/sveta-petka-fire.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Log fire for BBQ&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wine and rakia started flowing and soon those more musical than me started dancing the &amp;quot;Horo&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/sveta-petka-horo.webp&quot; alt=&quot;People line dancing the Horo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having relaxed in that spot for several hours, we continued on to catch the last of the sunset and then headed down the steep and rocky path with our head torches in the dark. After a quick stop at a rock called &amp;quot;Anathema&amp;quot;, we continued on to the little &amp;quot;Sveta Petka&amp;quot; church with this lovely view of the town beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/sveta-petka-cross.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Cross lit up at night with Asenovgrad glowing in the background&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a great day out. The last time I had done this hike was in snow with sub zero temperatures 20 years ago. This time it was 20¬∞C. I guess this is climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what it looked like 20 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/sveta-petka-2003.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Me sitting on a rock in the snow&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Frameworks</title>
		<link href="https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/frameworks/"/>
		<updated>2023-02-15T08:18:27Z</updated>
		<id>https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/frameworks/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently, I came across a couple of posts about the usefullness of JavaScript frameworks, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuejs.org/&quot;&gt;Vue&lt;/a&gt;. Their promise is to simplify the creation of modern web applications. These discussions seem to kick off every now and then in the same way that 20 years ago people debated Java vs .Net and 40 years ago it was probably C vs Perl. The current debate is often centered around the speed of the pages using frameworks, which are bulkier and slower than native rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://infrequently.org/2023/02/the-market-for-lemons/&quot;&gt;the market for lemons&lt;/a&gt;, Alex wrote a very good description of how these frameworks are knowingly over selling their benefits (faster development, easier to maintain, better support, access to a arger developer pool). A key takeaway for me was that these frameworks do give significant benefits to large teams able to invest and maintain in them. Smaller teams however, tend to get bogged down in their complexity the moment you go beyond the defaults. It&#39;s a bit like the &amp;quot;blog in five minutes&amp;quot; use cases that popped up all over the place when &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubyonrails.org/&quot;&gt;Ruby On Rails&lt;/a&gt; turned up 20 years ago. Of course RoR was truly revolutionary at the time and incredibly powerful, but the same was not true for other frameworks of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, Laurie posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://seldo.com/posts/the_case_for_frameworks&quot;&gt;the case for frameworks&lt;/a&gt; in support of React and JavaScript frameworks. His main argument, whilst acknowlegding certain failings of frameworks, is that you&#39;re OK because everyone is doing it. This is the 2020s reload of the &amp;quot;no one ever got fired for picking IBM&amp;quot; thinking in the 80s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But are these frameworks as popular as they seem. Andy takes a look his post &lt;a href=&quot;https://andy-bell.co.uk/the-extremely-loud-minority/&quot;&gt;the (extremely) loud minority&lt;/a&gt; and concludes &amp;quot;not really&amp;quot;. Obviously there are thousands of sites using React, but only 3.3% of the top 10 million websites actually use it. The percentage of all websites is probably much smaller. In comparison, Wordpress is used by 43.1% of the top 10 million websites. The reason these frameworks seem more popular than they actually is explained in &lt;a href=&quot;https://adactio.com/journal/15011&quot;&gt;dev perception&lt;/a&gt; by Jeremy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to note that &lt;a href=&quot;https://jquery.com/&quot;&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt; is still used on over 77% of the top 10 million websites. 16 years after it&#39;s first release. It&#39;s popularity is only now starting to dip. There are many reasons for it&#39;s popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason is that jQuery was released at a time when web standards were poorly supported by browsers. This meant developers had to write code for each of the common browsers at the time. jQuery provided a standardising layer, which enabled your code to work well in all browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second is that it was not released by a big tech company. jQuery was created by one guy, John Resig. Since there was no big company owning jQuery, other companies didn&#39;t feel the need to compete and release their own framework. There was no competition and it quickly became the defacto framework used by anyone programming front-end JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third reason is that jQuery was quite simple to get started with. You could sprinkle it lightly throughout your code, or you could base all your code around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for it&#39;s recent dip: browsers are finally more or less equal in terms of standars support and the use case for jQuery is waning, especially in new projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this leads me to the actual point I want to make. It&#39;s about the most common framework, used by 100% of all websites. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldWideWeb&quot;&gt;work in progress since 1990&lt;/a&gt;. It is of course the browser using standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Sure, it doesn&#39;t always have the latest bells and whistles like, instead its future support is unparalled. It will never be obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&#39;t go wrong choosing it. In fact you can&#39;t avoid choosing it!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Safer Internet Day - 2023</title>
		<link href="https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/safer-internet-day-2023/"/>
		<updated>2023-02-10T13:18:27Z</updated>
		<id>https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/safer-internet-day-2023/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tuesday 7th February was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.saferinternetday.org/&quot;&gt;Safer Internet Day&lt;/a&gt; in 2023. It also marks the 20th year of the initiative, which is supported by the European Commission through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/safer-internet-day&quot;&gt;Safer Internet team of DG CONNECT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of that day, we arranged a morning in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lmrl.lu/&quot;&gt;Lycee Michel-Rodange&lt;/a&gt; in Luxembourg City, to let a class of the school try out the latest VR headsets from Meta. The kids, all around 15 years of age, got to try out five different VR worlds as they circulated around different stands in a class room. After that they had a brief discussion, giving their thoughts on VR in their futures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been a long time since I was in a class room full of 15 year olds and it was incredibly energising. They were all well behaved, whilst having their fun with the headsets. Maybe that is the Luxembourg effect!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best of all, in my opinion, was the lack of enthusiasm for this technology with these kids. Our polling showed they did not believe this technology would become an alternate world for them in the future. Whilst they saw the use of it in certain educational situations, few would be interested VR being their main medium of education. Despite growing up with always connected smartphones, they still apparently wanted face to face contact with their friends. They certainly didn&#39;t want to live in the VR world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own take on this, having tried out the headsets, is that they are simply not ready for the mainstream. The technology is too fiddly and, despite being relatively easy to use, is too cumbersome to do what appear to be basic things. I certainly can&#39;t see the advantage over a physical meeting with colleagues, or even a video-conference. There&#39;s still a long way to go before this tech can become mainstream. Maybe it never will, at least not in this form. And certainly not for entertainment or socialising purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The calm before the storm:&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let the VR begin:&lt;br /&gt;

		<title>European Bac choices toolkkit</title>
		<link href="https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/bac-choices/"/>
		<updated>2023-01-31T13:18:27Z</updated>
		<id>https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/bac-choices/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this week my younger daughter has to have chosen the subjects she wants to study for her European Baccalaureate. For those in the UK, this is equivalent to choosing your A levels, but much more complicated. This i not to say that it is easier, since these are always difficult choices. Just that there are subjects that are compulsory and more rules about which combination of subjects are not allowed. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.euroschool.lu/site/secondary-s6-s7-subject-choice-booklet/#1575669389394-aa74a39f-b3ba&quot;&gt;exact rules can be found here&lt;/a&gt;, but since that link is likely to break in the future, I recap them here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Compulsory subjects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must take a number of compulsory subjects, which are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Language 1, 4 periods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Language 2, 3 periods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maths: either 3 or 5 periods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biology 2 periods
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unless Biology, Physics or Chemisty are taken as 4 period subjects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geography 2 periods
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unless taken as a 4 period subject&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History 2 periods
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unless taken as a 4 period subject&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Philiosophy 2 periods
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unless taken as a 4 period subject&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ethics 1 period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical Education 2 periods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Optional subjects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addtion you must choose a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 4 optional 4 period subjects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chemistry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Art&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geography&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Philosophy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Language 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economics or Latin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Language 4 or ONL (Other National Language)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Advanced subjects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also choose one advanced subject from the three available (in addition to their normal level):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced Language 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced Language 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced Maths
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only if Maths 5 period is chosen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all of the above (compulsory, optional and advanced), you must have a minimum of 29 periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Complementary subjects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also choose a range of complementary subjects, which are 2 periods each. I won&#39;t list them all here except that ones that have conditions attached to them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laboratory in Biology, Physics or Chemistry
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can only choose one of these and only if you are doing the equivalent 4 period subject&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction to Economics
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cannot be chosen if you have chosen 4 period economics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Total periods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of your chosen subjects must amount to at least 31 periods and maximum 35 periods. You can go slightly higher, but this needs permission from the school. You cannot go lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final exam choices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the above has important ramnifications for the subjects you are examined in at the end of the Bac. All the subjects count towards your bac, but those you choose to be examined in count much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot choose complementary subjects for these exams. If you choose one of the advanced subjects you must be examined in it. In addition there are written and oral exams, some of which cannot be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the written exams, of which you take five, your choices are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compulsory: Language 1 (or advanced if taken)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compulsory: Language 2 (or advanced if taken)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compulsory: Maths 3 or 5 period (depending on which you chose)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choice from:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two of the 4 period subjects you have chosen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition you cannot choose for the oral exams a subject you chose as one your choices for the 4 period subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the oral exams, of which you take three, your choices are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compulsory: Language 1 (or advanced if taken)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choice from:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Language 2 (or advanced if taken)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced is compulsory if chosen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History 2 or 4 periods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geography 2 or 4 periods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choice from:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most of the other 4 period subjects, unless chosen as the second option above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I explain all this because it means you might end up with no choices in the exams you have to take, depending on your subject choices for the bac. But understanding this can be quite complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I coded up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/html/bac-choices.html&quot;&gt;european bac subject toolkit&lt;/a&gt; to help my daughter visualise the consequences of her subject choices on the final bac exams she will have to take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I coded the entire toolkit without resorting to any frameworks or external scripts. These would have taken me much longer to learn than simply using vanilla JavaScript. What is good to see is how far in built browser support for lots of JavaScript functionality has come.  For this little toolkit using any kind of framework would have been complete overkill.&lt;/p&gt;
