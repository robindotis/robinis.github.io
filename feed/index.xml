&lt;p&gt;I got through this book in 10 days whilst on holiday. Reading it over such a short time frame helped me to keep the storyline fresh in mind. Maybe because of this, I feel it is certainly one of the better Culture series books. Somewhat unusually it ties up all the loose ends and leaves nothing unexplained. Maybe because by now readers are aware of the all encompassing power of the Culture civilisation and the trickery this enables them engage in. And yet it is not necessarily the most powerful civilisation.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/byala-cherkva/&quot;&gt;short hike yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, we decided to follow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hikes-and-walks.com/hike/bulgaria/fotinski-waterfalls&quot;&gt;Waterfall trail in Fotinovo&lt;/a&gt;, about 100 minutes drive from Plovdiv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a 6km hike to the waterfalls and back, as well as a steep descent to actually see the waterfalls. Most of the info I could find about the trail indicated this was an easy hike. The descent to the waterfalls and subsequent climb back up are anything but. It didn&#39;t help that we did the hike on the hottest day of the year so far. It was 33¬∞C in Fotinovo and 40¬∞C in Plovdiv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waterfalls were interesting and worth the effort, but not exceptionally so. Maybe they are more imposing in the spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/fotinovo-1.webp&quot; alt=&quot;The waterfalls seen from the bottom&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We spent an hour hiking around the &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/maps/3Dz1p9kAH55Z9jAr9&quot;&gt;Byala Cherkva&lt;/a&gt; area inn order to escape the 39¬∞C heat in Plovdiv. It&#39;s not really a starting point for any trails, so we just set off down the road and turned round 45 minutes later. It was a nice walk, still hot despite being half way up the Rodopi mountains.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://visitkapana.bg/en/about-the-district/&quot;&gt;Kapana&lt;/a&gt; (–ö–∞–ø–∞–Ω–∞), Bulgarian for trap, is an area of central Plovdiv with small streets.  Traditional where handicrafts people setup their workshops, it was then a bit of an artists area. For as long as I have known Plovdiv (around 20 years) it was always a bit of a rundown and underused area, from a tourist perspective. It has been completely redone in the last couple of years and turned into a great street cafe area. It&#39;s especially busy in the evenings and judging by the languages I heard, popular with the tourists. Well worth a visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/kapana-1.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Kapana in the late evening&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/kapana-2.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Kapana in the late evening&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a great vegan meal in a small cafe called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.veggic.bg/&quot;&gt;VEGGIC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/kapana-3.webp&quot; alt=&quot;VEGGIC restaurant serving great vegan food&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course all progress has its downsides. This sort of gentrification also means the people who used to run art ateliers and crafts workshops here can no longer afford to do so. Thankfully though there are, in my opinion, still enough areas of central Plovdiv that need restoring that those traders will find somewhere nearby to set up shop. I hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were 18 people watching, possibly we were the only ones not included in &amp;quot;Family and Friends&amp;quot; üôÇ. The group is great so it&#39;s surprising there weren&#39;t more people in the audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A straightforward read about what happens when you use the data available to answer interesting questions. The key being that you need to know to ask these interesting questions in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the data driven world we now live in it is on the one hand now not that exceptional, 20 years after it&#39;s first publication. On the other hand it underlines the need to ask interesting questions if we are going to make good use of all this data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the added on chapters included the question &amp;quot;Why do people vote when no single vote ever really matters&amp;quot;. Whilst the point being is valid, in reality every vote counts. As the recent, potentially manipulated by targeted advertising, vote on Brexit showed.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Not one, but two concerts in a week for us. We just got back from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/rock-werchter-2023/&quot;&gt;Rock Werchter on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday 4th July and we were back in front of a stage. This time watching the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arcticmonkeys.com/&quot;&gt;Arctic Monkeys&lt;/a&gt; at the more conveniently located Luxexpo in Luxembourg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got there at 8.45pm, just in time to watch the band take the stage. Not really knowing too much of their music, I found it interesting and well worth attending. The stage setup and the music was a bit of throwback to the &#39;50s which made the whole evening very nice.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Having enjoyed last year&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robin.is/posts/2022/rock-werchter-2022/&quot;&gt;day at Rock Werchter&lt;/a&gt; so much, we got to tickets to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://redhotchilipeppers.com/&quot;&gt;Red Hot Chili Peppers&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rockwerchter.be/en/&quot;&gt;Rock Werchter 2023&lt;/a&gt; this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Black Keys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it was a work day, we only got there around 6.30pm and first up were the Black Keys. They were not really our thing, but it was a good start to the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/black-keys.webp&quot; alt=&quot;The Black Keys playing on the Main stage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Hu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst waiting for Liam Gallagher to appear on the main stage, we walked around a little and caught the last few minutes of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thehuofficial.com/music&quot;&gt;The Hu&lt;/a&gt; on the Klub C stage. They are a monogolian rock / techno / group whom I did not know before and they were great. I will have to find another show of theirs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/the-hu.webp&quot; alt=&quot;The Hu playing on the Klub C stage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we ambled over to the Slope where we watched Canadian group &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.puptheband.com/&quot;&gt;Pup&lt;/a&gt; for about 15 minutes, who were also good fun whith fantastic music. Interestingly the Slope had been turned around so it faced the stage, rather than the stage being underneath it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/pup.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Pup playing on the Slope stage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Liam Gallagher&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We returned to the main stage to watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.liamgallagher.com/home/&quot;&gt;Liam Gallagher&lt;/a&gt; play, but we were not impressed. Nor were the crowd I don&#39;t think. Oasis were great in their day and their songs are still fantastic. But on stage, Liam was very poor and lifeless. I realise that is his thing, but times have changed and I think crowds expect more of a show. It didn&#39;t help that he completely failed to build up a connection with the crowd - his arrogant appearance and inuendos not really making an impact. You&#39;re not in Manchester, Liam, it&#39;s Rock Werchter!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/liam-gallagher.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Liam Gallagher on the main stage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Red Hot Chili Peppers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hung around near the front of the Main stage for an hour, until Red Hot Chili Peppers were on at 23:30. We were thinking of getting into the enclosure right in front of the stage, but decided not to. So we watched them from the &amp;quot;second row&amp;quot; as it were. They were great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/rhcp-1.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Flea and John Frusciante performing on the Main stage.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/rhcp-2.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Anthony Kiedes singing on the Main stage.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/rhcp-3.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Chad Smith on the drums for Red Hot Chili Peppers.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;by Alain de Botton&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting read about how basic human psychology affects the daily life of all of us in much the same way. We shouldn&#39;t take the actions of others personally. Rather, we should think of them as reaction to the inner problems of others. Probably we should have pity on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise all our freakish, perverted and non-sensical thoughts are actually perfectly normal. Everyone has similar thoughts going through their heads more or less all the same time. It&#39;s not just us. Our worries and anxietes? It&#39;s not just us, it&#39;s everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sentence from the end of the book is a good summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all, where it counts, steering almost blind&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or as I like to think of it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost everyone, almost of the time, is just winging it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I started watching a Netflix series called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8421350/&quot;&gt;Manifest&lt;/a&gt; back in Summer last year. Today I completed watching it after they released the final 10 episodes a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robin.is/posts/2022/manifest/&quot;&gt;previous post on the series&lt;/a&gt;, the series got a bit repetitive with the heroes following calling after calling without any real or obvious development towards an end. Nevertheless I wanted to see the conclusion of this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
    &lt;summary&gt;Spoiler Alert!&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, given the tendency for happy endings in Hollywood this one was not hard to guess in advance. The plane returns back where it came from and lands as it should have done in 2013. Whilst the passengers on the plane still know what has happened, those greeting them do not. Which leads to an interesting final few minutes as the individual story lines are wrapped up with what the passengers learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, nowadays no series ends without a chance for a spin off. Those passengers who could not redeem themselves in the five and half years during which they were gone have disappeared from the plane. The series ends with the same FBI agent who was the lead in investigating the dissapearance of the plane, now turning up to investigate the dissapearance of the 11 missing passengers.&lt;/p&gt;
