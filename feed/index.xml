&lt;p&gt;A straightforward read about what happens when you use the data available to answer interesting questions. The key being that you need to know to ask these interesting questions in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the data driven world we now live in it is on the one hand now not that exceptional, 20 years after it&#39;s first publication. On the other hand it underlines the need to ask interesting questions if we are going to make good use of all this data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the added on chapters included the question &amp;quot;Why do people vote when no single vote ever really matters&amp;quot;. Whilst the point being is valid, in reality every vote counts. As the recent, potentially manipulated by targeted advertising, vote on Brexit showed.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Not one, but two concerts in a week for us. We just got back from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/rock-werchter-2023/&quot;&gt;Rock Werchter on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday 4th July and we were back in front of a stage. This time watching the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arcticmonkeys.com/&quot;&gt;Arctic Monkeys&lt;/a&gt; at the more conveniently located Luxexpo in Luxembourg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got there at 8.45pm, just in time to watch the band take the stage. Not really knowing too much of their music, I found it interesting and well worth attending. The stage setup and the music was a bit of throwback to the &#39;50s which made the whole evening very nice.&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2023-07-01T09:20:30Z</updated>
		<id>https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/rock-werchter-2023/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Having enjoyed last year&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robin.is/posts/2022/rock-werchter-2022/&quot;&gt;day at Rock Werchter&lt;/a&gt; so much, we got to tickets to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://redhotchilipeppers.com/&quot;&gt;Red Hot Chili Peppers&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rockwerchter.be/en/&quot;&gt;Rock Werchter 2023&lt;/a&gt; this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Black Keys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it was a work day, we only got there around 6.30pm and first up were the Black Keys. They were not really our thing, but it was a good start to the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/black-keys.webp&quot; alt=&quot;The Black Keys playing on the Main stage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Hu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst waiting for Liam Gallagher to appear on the main stage, we walked around a little and caught the last few minutes of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thehuofficial.com/music&quot;&gt;The Hu&lt;/a&gt; on the Klub C stage. They are a monogolian rock / techno / group whom I did not know before and they were great. I will have to find another show of theirs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/the-hu.webp&quot; alt=&quot;The Hu playing on the Klub C stage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we ambled over to the Slope where we watched Canadian group &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.puptheband.com/&quot;&gt;Pup&lt;/a&gt; for about 15 minutes, who were also good fun whith fantastic music. Interestingly the Slope had been turned around so it faced the stage, rather than the stage being underneath it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/pup.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Pup playing on the Slope stage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Liam Gallagher&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We returned to the main stage to watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.liamgallagher.com/home/&quot;&gt;Liam Gallagher&lt;/a&gt; play, but we were not impressed. Nor were the crowd I don&#39;t think. Oasis were great in their day and their songs are still fantastic. But on stage, Liam was very poor and lifeless. I realise that is his thing, but times have changed and I think crowds expect more of a show. It didn&#39;t help that he completely failed to build up a connection with the crowd - his arrogant appearance and inuendos not really making an impact. You&#39;re not in Manchester, Liam, it&#39;s Rock Werchter!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/liam-gallagher.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Liam Gallagher on the main stage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Red Hot Chili Peppers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hung around near the front of the Main stage for an hour, until Red Hot Chili Peppers were on at 23:30. We were thinking of getting into the enclosure right in front of the stage, but decided not to. So we watched them from the &amp;quot;second row&amp;quot; as it were. They were great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/rhcp-1.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Flea and John Frusciante performing on the Main stage.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/rhcp-2.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Anthony Kiedes singing on the Main stage.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/rhcp-3.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Chad Smith on the drums for Red Hot Chili Peppers.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/rhcp-4.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Two girls on the shoulders of their friends in front of the main stage watching Red Hot Chili Peppers.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/rhcp-5.webp&quot; alt=&quot;The final song of the Red Hot Chili Peppers at Rock Werchter 2023.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good Night Rock Werchter, again!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The School Of Life</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;by Alain de Botton&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting read about how basic human psychology affects the daily life of all of us in much the same way. We shouldn&#39;t take the actions of others personally. Rather, we should think of them as reaction to the inner problems of others. Probably we should have pity on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise all our freakish, perverted and non-sensical thoughts are actually perfectly normal. Everyone has similar thoughts going through their heads more or less all the same time. It&#39;s not just us. Our worries and anxietes? It&#39;s not just us, it&#39;s everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sentence from the end of the book is a good summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all, where it counts, steering almost blind&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or as I like to think of it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost everyone, almost of the time, is just winging it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

		<title>Manifest - again</title>
		<link href="https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/manifest-again/"/>
		<updated>2023-06-11T22:00:33Z</updated>
		<id>https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/manifest-again/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I started watching a Netflix series called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8421350/&quot;&gt;Manifest&lt;/a&gt; back in Summer last year. Today I completed watching it after they released the final 10 episodes a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robin.is/posts/2022/manifest/&quot;&gt;previous post on the series&lt;/a&gt;, the series got a bit repetitive with the heroes following calling after calling without any real or obvious development towards an end. Nevertheless I wanted to see the conclusion of this story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
    &lt;summary&gt;Spoiler Alert!&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, given the tendency for happy endings in Hollywood this one was not hard to guess in advance. The plane returns back where it came from and lands as it should have done in 2013. Whilst the passengers on the plane still know what has happened, those greeting them do not. Which leads to an interesting final few minutes as the individual story lines are wrapped up with what the passengers learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, nowadays no series ends without a chance for a spin off. Those passengers who could not redeem themselves in the five and half years during which they were gone have disappeared from the plane. The series ends with the same FBI agent who was the lead in investigating the dissapearance of the plane, now turning up to investigate the dissapearance of the 11 missing passengers.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Public luxury, Private sufficiency</title>
		<link href="https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/public-private/"/>
		<updated>2023-06-09T19:18:27Z</updated>
		<id>https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/public-private/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I read an interesting article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/the-planets-economist-has-kate-raworth-found-a-model-for-sustainable-living&quot;&gt;Kate Raworth and her Doughnut Economics book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea is worth repeating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;public luxury and private sufficiency&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea being that shared public life and infrastructure should be rich and luxurious, whereas in private we should all be sufficient, consuming as little as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example is building large cycle lanes and good public transport systems at the expense of the private car.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Bridel Circular Walk</title>
		<link href="https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/bridel-circular-walk/"/>
		<updated>2023-05-28T11:43:28Z</updated>
		<id>https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/bridel-circular-walk/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This was a simple 8.3km &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visitluxembourg.com/tour/circular-walk-bridel&quot;&gt;circular walk through the woods around Bridel and Kopstal&lt;/a&gt;. It was a lovely warm sunny Sunday morning day for fast paced walk with Angie. The page said the route takes two hours 20 minutes, but it took me and Angie only one hour and 45 minutes, which is what I would have expected for an 8km walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walk itself was really easy with only slight inclines, almost all of it in the shade, so Angie loved it.  Unusually for these circular walks, there wasn&#39;t really any view or historical point of interest. There was however some interesting information on the local water systems and how rainwater gets converted into drinking water. On this image is a German poem about the process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.robin.is/assets/images/2023/bridel-1.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Der Luxemburger Sandstein, In den Kl√ºften und Spalten wird das Grundwasser gefiltert, In der Tiefe wird das Grundwasser gespeichert, Dar Grundwasser tritt in den Quellen im Mamertal zu Tage.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In English this means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Luxembourg Sandstone&lt;br /&gt;
The ground water is filtered in the chasms and cracks&lt;br /&gt;
The ground water is stored in the deep&lt;br /&gt;
The ground water comes into the daylight in the Mamer valley&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

		<title>Improving the pipeline</title>
		<link href="https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/publication-pipeline/"/>
		<updated>2023-05-24T07:12:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://www.robin.is/posts/2023/publication-pipeline/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since moving this site to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.dev/&quot;&gt;Eleventy&lt;/a&gt; back in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robin.is/posts/2021/welcome-back/&quot;&gt;December 2020&lt;/a&gt; I&#39;ve been continually improving my publication pipeline. It started out being a manual process running bits of hacked together code on my laptop before switching to my online tool of the day for pushing the changes to the hosted site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time I was using &lt;a href=&quot;https://tina.io/forestry/&quot;&gt;Forestry.io&lt;/a&gt; which is now discontinued and I never really took to it&#39;s replacement. So I settled on simply using Github for everything. This means the source for code is pushed from my laptop to  Github, the published site is on Github Pages and the processing for creating the site from the source is managed through Github Actions. Initiallly triggering these three parts were things I did manually and separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I soon started scripting these actions in Powershell. The first script simply pushed the changes to github. I modified this to include a pull from github before the push, to ensure there were no conflicts when pushing. After running the script, I would manually switch to GitHub to run the workkflow in GitHub Actions that actually updated the site with the changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, yesterday I finally added that task to the script as well. Using the GitHub Rest API is straighforward and creating the correct curl command was relatively easy. But I don&#39;t know much about curl and in any case the script is a powershell script. Some Googling (mainly using Bing üôÇ) got me most of the way there, by using the &lt;code&gt;Invoke-RestMethod&lt;/code&gt;. But I wasn&#39;t sure how to add one property to the command. Thankfully I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/73773558/131948&quot;&gt;a code snippet on Stackoverflow&lt;/a&gt; which gave me what I needed. It had no explanations or comments, it was just posted as an answer to a question as is. Nevertheless it solved my problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so this post becomes the first one pushed to GitHub and published on GitHub Pages using one integrated script. üëè&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spotted this display of Luxembourg&#39;s Restaurant Computer Systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in 1982 and 1984 with a Commodore computer, moving to an Amiga and Kaypro in 1986, then to a touchscreen in 2003 and finally a tablet in 2023. Which one do you think is most usable? Personally I would go for the 2003 touchscreen, but I can understand the convenience of a tablet which the staff can carry around. But is that really an improvement on a pen and paper? ü§î&lt;/p&gt;
